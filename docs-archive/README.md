## **ðŸ“¦ Archived Documents**

This directory contains documentation that was found to contradict the canonical IDGL concept foundation during the systematic inconsistency audit of December 2024.

### **ðŸš¨ Why These Documents Were Archived:**

**Multiple Competing IDGL Frameworks:** These documents presented alternative definitions of IDGL that created:
- Framework confusion and implementation chaos
- Contradictory human-AI relationship models  
- Anti-IDGL methodologies (epic-based, user-story-based approaches)
- Task fragmentation vs. comprehensive generation

**Audit Reference:** See [INCONSISTENCY_AUDIT_REPORT.md](../intent-atlas/INCONSISTENCY_AUDIT_REPORT.md) for detailed conflict analysis.

## **ðŸ“‹ Archived Files:**

### **Alternative IDGL Frameworks:**
- `idgl-rationale-conflicting.md` - 3-stage lifecycle contradicting canonical approach
- `ai-participation-rules-conflicting.md` - "Collaborative partner" model vs. canonical "tactical executor"

### **Anti-IDGL Methodologies:**
- `epic-conventions-antipattern.md` - Epic-based approach contradicting intent-driven principles
- `user-story-conventions-antipattern.md` - User story methodology explicitly contradicting IDGL
- `solo-fullstack-workflow-fragmented.md` - Task fragmentation vs. comprehensive generation
- `session-checklist-administrative.md` - Administrative overhead vs. outcome-focused cycles
