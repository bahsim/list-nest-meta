# Unified Intent Enhancement Plan (AI-Driven, Accelerated)

## Objective
Rapidly elevate the unified intent system to full compliance with experimental guidance, maximize AI-native generativity, and ensure ongoing maintainability and clarity for both humans and AI—using automation and parallelization wherever possible.

---

## 1. Add Meta-Intents and System-Level Requirements
- **Action:** AI generates a draft `meta-intents.yaml` in `/07-unified-intent` (system requirements, governance, generativity principles).
- **Time:** <1 hour (AI), 1 hour (review)
- **Parallelizable:** Yes

## 2. Enhance AI-Native Guidance in All Intents
- **Action:** AI batch-inserts or enriches an `ai_integration` field for every intent in all YAMLs.
- **Time:** <1 hour (AI), 1–2 hours (review)
- **Parallelizable:** Yes





## 3. Decompose High-Level Intents into Atomic, Testable Requirements
- **Action:** AI suggests and drafts atomic intents from high-level ones; human review for acceptance.
- **Time:** 1–2 hours (AI), 1–2 hours (review)
- **Parallelizable:** Yes







## 4. Add Real-World Examples and User Scenarios
- **Action:** AI generates an `examples` or `scenarios` field for each intent.
- **Time:** <1 hour (AI), 1 hour (review)
- **Parallelizable:** Yes

## 5. Add Explicit Acceptance Criteria
- **Action:** AI generates an `acceptance_criteria` field for each intent.
- **Time:** <1 hour (AI), 1 hour (review)
- **Parallelizable:** Yes

## 6. Create a Root Index for Aggregation and Cross-Linking
- **Action:** AI generates a `root-index.yaml` or `.md` to aggregate and cross-link all domain and flow YAMLs.
- **Time:** <0.5 hour (AI), 0.5 hour (review)
- **Parallelizable:** Yes

## 7. Review and Iterative Improvement
- **Action:** AI runs automated validation scripts and generates review checklists; human review for compliance and feedback.
- **Time:** <1 hour (AI), 1 hour (review) per cycle
- **Parallelizable:** Yes

---

## Timeline Summary
- **All steps can be executed in parallel.**
- **Total AI time:** 3–5 hours (batch generation, validation, indexing)
- **Total human review time:** 4–8 hours (focused, parallelizable)
- **Total elapsed time:** **1–2 working days** (with focused effort and rapid feedback)

---

## Success Criteria
- All intents are atomic, testable, and AI-native.
- Meta-intents and system-level requirements are documented.
- Acceptance criteria and real-world examples are present for every intent.
- A root index provides clear navigation and aggregation.
- The system is regularly reviewed and improved as a living artifact.

## Note
With an AI-native, automation-first approach, the unified intent enhancement plan can be completed in 1–2 days. The only real bottleneck is human review and decision-making—not AI generation.
