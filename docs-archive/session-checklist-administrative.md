ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL WARNING: ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD CONTRADICTS IDGL** ðŸš¨

> **STATUS:** This checklist emphasizes **administrative process tracking** that contradicts canonical outcome-focused cycle principles.
> 
> **DO NOT USE** administrative session rituals for IDGL implementations. This creates process overhead vs. strategic outcomes.
> 
> **CANONICAL AUTHORITY:** Use only [Intent Atlas Canonical Concept Foundation](./intent-atlas/concept/) for cycle management approaches.
> 
> **AUDIT REFERENCE:** See [INCONSISTENCY_AUDIT_REPORT.md](./intent-atlas/INCONSISTENCY_AUDIT_REPORT.md) for process contradiction analysis.

# Session Start/End Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist ensures that every sessionâ€”whether new, resumed, human, or AIâ€”begins and ends with full clarity, context, and traceability. It enforces consistent progress tracking, status marking, and documentation, preventing ambiguity or drift across all project artifacts.

---

## Session Start Checklist

1. **Review Project Status**
   - Read the latest `PROJECT-STATUS.md` to understand the current phase, last completed action, blockers, and next step.
2. **Review Conventions**
   - Skim relevant conventions in `/00-meta/` (epic, user story, assistant session rules) to ensure compliance.
3. **Check Progress File**
   - Open the current progress file (e.g., `user-story-generation-progress.json` or equivalent).
   - Confirm what was last completed, what is in progress, and what is next.
4. **Summarize Session Context**
   - Write or state a brief summary: "Last completed: X. In progress: Y. Next step: Z."
5. **Identify Ambiguities**
   - Note any unclear or conflicting information and resolve before proceeding.

## Session End Checklist

1. **Mark Completions**
   - Update the `status` field in YAML frontmatter for any completed epic or user story files.
   - Update visual progress markers (ðŸŸ¦, âœ…) in roadmaps or summary tables as appropriate.
2. **Update Progress File**
   - Record all completed steps, new in-progress items, and any blockers in the progress file.
3. **Synchronize Status**
   - Ensure all status markers (YAML, progress file, roadmap) are consistent and up to date.
4. **Leave a Session Log**
   - Add a brief session log entry to the progress file or `PROJECT-STATUS.md`:
     - Who/what worked
     - What was accomplished
     - Any issues or notes for the next session
5. **Prepare for Next Session**
   - Clearly state the next actionable step or decision required.

## Rationale

- This ritual ensures that every session starts with full context and ends with a clear, documented handoffâ€”eliminating ambiguity, duplicated work, or lost progress.
- It enforces the "single source of truth" principle for status and progress, and supports seamless human-AI collaboration.
- By making the ritual explicit, any new or resuming contributor can follow it without prior context.

**All contributors (human and AI) must follow this checklist at every session boundary.**
