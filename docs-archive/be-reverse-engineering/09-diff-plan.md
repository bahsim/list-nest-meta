# Granular Comparison Plan: Original vs Regenerated Backend

1. For each module (wishlists, wishes, users, offers, auth, config):
   - List all files (entities, controllers, services, DTOs, guards, strategies, config, etc.) in both codebases.
2. For each file present in both:
   - Perform a line-by-line diff of file contents.
   - Highlight differences in:
     - Class/property/method names and signatures
     - Decorators and validation
     - Business logic and method bodies
     - Imports/exports and dependencies
     - Route paths and HTTP methods
     - Type definitions and field types
3. For files present in only one codebase:
   - Note as missing or extra.
4. Analyze semantic and architectural gaps:
   - Missing/extra endpoints, methods, or fields
   - Differences in validation logic
   - Differences in RBAC, guards, or authentication flows
   - Differences in error handling, logging, or event emission
   - Differences in configuration, environment, or utility files
   - Custom business logic not captured by patterns
5. Summarize and categorize inconsistencies:
   - Critical (breaks functionality or security)
   - Major (affects business logic or API contract)
   - Minor (naming, formatting, non-breaking structure)
6. For each inconsistency, provide actionable recommendations:
   - Pattern library extension
   - Manual intervention
   - Improved extraction/mapping logic
