# High-Level Comparison: Original vs Regenerated Backend

## Modules and Major Components

| Module      | Entities | Controllers | Services | DTOs | Guards | Strategies | Present in Original | Present in Regen |
|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|------|--------|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| wishlists   | Yes      | Yes         | Yes      | Yes  | No     | No         | Yes                 | Yes              |
| wishes      | Yes      | Yes         | Yes      | Yes  | Yes    | No         | Yes                 | Yes              |
| users       | Yes      | Yes         | Yes      | Yes  | No     | No         | Yes                 | Yes              |
| offers      | Yes      | Yes         | Yes      | Yes  | No     | No         | Yes                 | Yes              |
| auth        | No       | Yes         | Yes      | No   | Yes    | Yes        | Yes                 | Yes              |
| config      | Yes      | No          | No       | No   | No     | No         | Yes                 | No               |

## Summary of Major Inconsistencies

- `config` module is present in the original but missing in the regenerated backend.
- All primary business modules (wishlists, wishes, users, offers, auth) are present in both codebases.
- All major components (entities, controllers, services, DTOs, guards, strategies) for these modules are present in both codebases, except:
  - No entities, DTOs, or services for `auth` in the original (likely handled differently or inlined).
  - No guards or strategies for non-auth modules in either codebase.

## Structural Mismatches

- Supporting files (e.g., configuration, environment, utility modules) may differ or be missing in the regenerated backend.
- Business logic and custom validation may not be fully captured by mid-level instructions.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to a more detailed, file-by-file and semantic comparison if needed.
- Review and address missing modules/components, especially `config` and any custom logic.
