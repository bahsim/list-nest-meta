# Detailed Comparison: Original vs Regenerated Backend

## wishlists
- Entities: Present in both
- Controller: Present in both
- Service: Present in both
- DTOs: Present in both
- Guards/Strategies: None in either

## wishes
- Entities: Present in both
- Controller: Present in both
- Service: Present in both
- DTOs: Present in both
- Guards: Present in both (wish-owner.guard.ts)
- Strategies: None in either

## users
- Entities: Present in both
- Controller: Present in both
- Service: Present in both
- DTOs: Present in both
- Guards/Strategies: None in either

## offers
- Entities: Present in both
- Controller: Present in both
- Service: Present in both
- DTOs: Present in both
- Services: Present in both (offers-repository.service.ts, offers-validation.service.ts)
- Guards/Strategies: None in either

## auth
- Controller: Present in both
- Service: Present in both
- Guards: Present in both (jwt-auth.guard.ts, local-auth.guard.ts, optional-jwt-auth.guard.ts)
- Strategies: Present in both (local.strategy.ts, jwt.strategy.ts)
- Entities/DTOs: None in either

## config
- Present in original only (configuration.ts)
- Missing in regenerated backend

## Supporting Files
- `main.ts`, `app.module.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `nest-cli.json`, `package.json`: Present in regenerated backend
- May differ in content/structure from original

## Key Findings
- All primary business modules and their core files are present in both codebases.
- The `config` module is missing in the regenerated backend.
- All DTOs, entities, controllers, and services are present and structurally aligned for business modules.
- Guards and strategies are present for `auth` and `wishes` as expected.
- Supporting files are present in the regenerated backend but may differ in content from the original.
- Custom business logic, configuration, and utility files may not be fully captured by mid-level instructions and are likely missing or simplified in the regenerated backend.
