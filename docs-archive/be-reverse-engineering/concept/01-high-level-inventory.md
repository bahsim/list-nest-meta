# High-Level Inventory: Conceptual Documentation

This document provides a high-level summary and inventory of the conceptual documentation reverse-engineered from the backend. It outlines the main sections and their purpose, serving as a guide for onboarding, architecture review, and future development.

## Inventory of Conceptual Documentation

### 1. Service Responsibilities and Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **File:** `05-service-responsibilities.md`
- **Description:** Summarizes the main responsibilities, business logic, and cross-cutting concerns (validation, authorization, transactionality) for each core service (users, wishes, wishlists, offers, auth).

### 2. Domain Models: Properties and Relationships
- **File:** `15-domain-models.md`
- **Description:** Details the main properties, types, constraints, and relationships for each core domain model (User, Wish, Wishlist, Offer), including validation and association patterns.

### 3. Controller Endpoints and Responsibilities
- **File:** `04-controller-endpoints.md`
- **Description:** Lists the main endpoints, HTTP methods, route patterns, and notable guards for each core controller, providing a clear map of the API surface.

### 4. Architecture Elements and Global Patterns
- **File:** `14-architecture-elements.md`
- **Description:** Describes the root module structure, database configuration, module imports, authentication guards and strategies, modular architecture, and global patterns.

## Value and Next Steps

This conceptual documentation provides a clear, structured, and actionable overview of the backend's architecture, responsibilities, and API surface. It is valuable for onboarding new developers, conducting architecture reviews, and planning future enhancements or refactoring. 

**Next steps:**
- Review and validate the documentation for completeness and accuracy.
- Use as a foundation for further enrichment (e.g., add diagrams, sequence flows, or business rules).
- Keep the documentation up to date as the system evolves.
