# High-Level Conceptual Documentation Plan

## Phase 1: Preparation
- Inventory all modules, features, and components in the backend codebase.
- Identify key architectural elements (modules, services, entities, controllers, configuration, etc.).
- Gather any existing documentation, diagrams, or ADRs for context.

## Phase 2: Automated Extraction
- Parse codebase to extract:
  - Module and dependency graph
  - Entity/domain model definitions and relationships
  - Controller endpoints and main flows
  - Service responsibilities and cross-cutting concerns
  - Configuration and environment structure
- Aggregate extracted data into a structured inventory for review.

## Phase 3: Manual Enrichment
- Review extracted inventory for completeness and business meaning.
- Add missing context, business rules, and domain-specific logic not captured by automation.
- Summarize key design decisions, architectural patterns, and rationale.

## Phase 4: Documentation Synthesis
- Organize content into clear, high-level documentation sections:
  - System architecture overview
  - Domain model diagrams and descriptions
  - Key API flows and use cases
  - Configuration and environment overview
  - Notable design decisions and rationale
- Use diagrams, tables, and narrative as appropriate.

## Phase 5: Validation and Iteration
- Review documentation with stakeholders and technical leads.
- Validate accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
- Iterate based on feedback and update as the system evolves.
