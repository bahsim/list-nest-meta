# Stage 2: Architectural Design Deep-Dive

**Purpose:** Generate comprehensive architectural design rationale that explains WHY the systematic ordering matters, not just WHAT to build

**Prerequisites:** Completed Stage 1 with strategic plan and implementation plan

---

## Prompt: Comprehensive Architectural Design Rationale

```markdown
You are a senior software architect creating definitive documentation that explains the deep architectural reasoning behind systematic NestJS backend generation.

## INPUT CONTEXT:
- Strategic plan from Stage 1
- Implementation plan from Stage 1  
- Business domain: [YOUR DOMAIN]
- Technical approach: Systematic dependency-driven generation framework

## YOUR TASK:
Create a comprehensive architectural design rationale (architectural-design-rationale.md) that includes:

### 1. Executive Summary (50-75 lines)
- Why systematic ordering is strategic, not arbitrary
- Key principles driving the architectural decisions
- How this approach differs from ad-hoc development
- Strategic benefits for teams, maintainability, and scalability

### 2. Phase-Level Architecture Analysis (75-100 lines)
- **Scaffolding Phase:** Why foundation must come before implementation
  * Tool-leveraged setup using NestJS CLI
  * Configuration-driven module generation
  * What this phase enables and validates
- **Generation Phase:** Why systematic step ordering matters
  * Dependency-driven code generation
  * Complexity progression strategy
  * Risk mitigation through incremental validation

### 3. Step-Level Dependency Analysis (150-200 lines)
- **Entities (Foundation):** Zero dependencies, everything builds on domain models
  * Why entities must be defined first
  * How entities enable all subsequent steps
  * What breaks without proper entity foundation
- **DTOs (Contracts):** Depends on entities, enables services and controllers
  * Why DTOs need entity field definitions
  * How DTOs define API contracts
  * Why validation decorators depend on entity constraints
- **Services (Business Logic):** Depends on entities + DTOs, enables auth and controllers
  * Why services need entity repositories and DTO types
  * How business rules build on data models
  * Why service interfaces enable authentication
- **Auth (Security):** Depends on user entity + service, enables protected endpoints
  * Why authentication requires user management
  * How JWT strategy depends on user service
  * Why guards need service-level validation
- **Controllers (API):** Depends on all previous, enables external integration
  * Why controllers need complete business logic stack
  * How API endpoints require authentication and validation
  * Why REST layer comes after business logic
- **App Config (Integration):** Depends on all components, orchestrates system
  * Why application configuration needs all modules
  * How global setup requires complete component inventory
  * Why integration comes after individual components work

### 4. Complexity Progression Strategy (75-100 lines)
- How complexity builds systematically from simple to sophisticated
- Why this supports both human developers and AI assistants
- How incremental validation prevents architectural mistakes
- Why this approach scales across teams and business domains

### 5. Business Rules Alignment (50-75 lines)
- How technical ordering supports business requirements implementation
- Why systematic approach enforces consistent business rule application
- How dependency chain ensures data integrity and security
- Why this architecture prevents common business logic mistakes

### 6. Strategic Benefits Justification (75-100 lines)
- **Failure Isolation:** How early detection prevents downstream problems
- **Cognitive Load Management:** Why systematic approach reduces mental overhead
- **Team Scaling:** How clear patterns enable multiple developers
- **AI-Assisted Development:** Why structured approach enables reliable automation
- **Maintainability:** How systematic patterns support long-term code health

### 7. Visual Architecture Representation
Create a Mermaid diagram showing:
- Phase dependencies (Scaffolding â†’ Generation)
- Step dependencies within Generation phase
- Component relationships and data flow
- Color-coded complexity levels

## SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

### Detailed Technical Justification:
- Each architectural decision must include concrete technical reasoning
- Dependency explanations must show what breaks when violated
- Must explain both immediate and long-term benefits

### Business Context Integration:
- Architectural decisions must connect to business value
- Technical patterns must support business rule enforcement
- Must demonstrate ROI for systematic approach investment

### AI-Assisted Development Focus:
- Explain why structured approach enables reliable AI code generation
- Show how systematic patterns reduce AI assistant cognitive load
- Demonstrate consistency benefits for automated development

### Team Adoption Guidance:
- Include practical guidance for teams adopting this approach
- Address common concerns about development velocity
- Provide evidence for quality improvements and risk reduction

## DELIVERABLES:
- 400+ line comprehensive architectural rationale
- Clear explanations suitable for both technical and business audiences
- Mermaid diagram illustrating dependencies and complexity progression
- Actionable guidance for teams implementing systematic approach

## QUALITY CRITERIA:
- Each architectural decision justified with concrete benefits
- Technical reasoning supported by dependency analysis
- Business value clearly connected to technical approach
- Educational resource enabling team understanding and adoption

## VALIDATION:
- Architecture explanation enables team confidence in systematic approach
- Dependency analysis provides clear guidance for development ordering
- Business justification supports stakeholder approval and resource allocation
- Documentation quality supports long-term team knowledge transfer
```
