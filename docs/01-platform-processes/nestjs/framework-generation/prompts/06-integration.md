## Systematic Development Architecture

### Two-Phase Strategic Design
```
Phase 1: Scaffolding (Foundation) → Phase 2: Generation (Systematic Implementation)
```

### Six-Step Dependency Chain
```
Entities → DTOs → Services → Auth → Controllers → App Config
Foundation → Contracts → Business Logic → Security → API → Integration
```

**Core Principle:** Lower-level components generated before higher-level consumers, with systematic complexity progression and built-in quality validation.

### 2. Framework Philosophy Documentation (framework-philosophy.md)

#### IDGL Framework Principles:
```markdown
# Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL) Framework Philosophy

## What IDGL Represents

**IDGL** is sophisticated methodology for systematic software development that bridges business requirements and technical implementation through configuration-driven, dependency-aware generation.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Dependency-Driven Development
- **Principle:** Generate lower-level components before higher-level consumers
- **Benefit:** Prevents circular dependencies and integration issues
- **Implementation:** Entities → DTOs → Services → Auth → Controllers → App Config

#### 2. Complexity Progression
- **Principle:** Build complexity systematically from simple to sophisticated
- **Benefit:** Manageable cognitive load for both humans and AI assistants
- **Implementation:** Data models → Business logic → System integration

#### 3. Configuration-Driven Generation
- **Principle:** Single source of truth drives all generation decisions
- **Benefit:** Consistency, maintainability, and reliable AI-assisted development
- **Implementation:** Detailed specifications enable reliable code generation

#### 4. Quality-First Validation
- **Principle:** Built-in validation at every development step
- **Benefit:** Early error detection and quality assurance
- **Implementation:** Incremental validation with clear success criteria

### How IDGL Differs from Traditional Development

#### Traditional Ad-Hoc Development:
- Manual decisions at each step
- Inconsistent patterns and quality
- High cognitive load and error rates
- Difficult team scaling and knowledge transfer
