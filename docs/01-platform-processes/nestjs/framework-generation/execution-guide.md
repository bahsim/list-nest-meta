    ↓
02-architectural-design
    ↓  
03-scaffolding-setup
    ↓
04-generation-configs (most complex)

```

**Critical:** Each stage must be completed and validated before proceeding to the next

---

## Pre-Execution Setup

### Domain Analysis Required
Before starting, clearly define:
- **Business domain** (e.g., "e-commerce", "project management", "gift sharing")
- **Core entities** (e.g., User, Product, Order, Payment)
- **Key business rules** (e.g., "users cannot order their own products", "payments must be atomic")
- **Technical requirements** (authentication, validation, specific integrations)

### AI Assistant Preparation  
- Use an AI assistant capable of generating substantial documentation
- Ensure assistant understands NestJS, TypeORM, and systematic development
- Have your domain requirements clearly articulated

## Stage-by-Stage Execution

### **Stage 1: Strategic Foundation**
**File:** `prompts/01-strategic-foundation.md`

**What It Generates:**
- Strategic plan with business justification
- Implementation plan with timelines and validation
- High-level architectural decisions

**Validation:**
- Strategic plan addresses stakeholder concerns
- Implementation plan includes specific commands and validation steps
- Architecture decisions are justified with concrete benefits

**Time:** 1-2 hours

### **Stage 2: Architectural Design**
**File:** `prompts/02-architectural-design.md`

**What It Generates:**
- Comprehensive architectural design rationale
- Dependency analysis with visual diagrams
- Complexity progression strategy

**Validation:**
- Dependency ordering is clearly explained and justified
- Each architectural decision has concrete reasoning
- Diagrams accurately represent the systematic approach

**Time:** 2-3 hours

### **Stage 3: Scaffolding Setup**
**File:** `prompts/03-scaffolding-setup.md`

**What It Generates:**
- Automated scaffolding script
- Validation commands and procedures
- Infrastructure setup documentation

**Validation:**
- Script creates working NestJS project
- All modules and dependencies properly configured
- Validation commands verify successful setup

**Time:** 1-2 hours

### **Stage 4: Generation Configurations** ⭐ **Most Complex**
**File:** `prompts/04-generation-configs.md`

**What It Generates:**
- 6 complete step configurations (entities, DTOs, services, auth, controllers, app config)
- Granular entity-specific configuration files
- Business rules mapped to implementation patterns

**Validation:**
- Each step has complete configuration specifications
- Entity configurations are detailed enough for AI code generation
- Business rules are consistently enforced across all configurations

**Time:** 3-4 hours

### **Stage 5: Business Rules**
**File:** `prompts/05-business-rules.md`

**What It Generates:**
- Comprehensive business rules reference
- Implementation patterns and error handling
- Code generation overview documentation

**Validation:**
- Business rules are unambiguous and implementable
- Error scenarios are clearly defined
- Implementation patterns are consistent

**Time:** 1-2 hours

### **Stage 6: Integration**
**File:** `prompts/06-integration.md`

**What It Generates:**
- Master documentation tying everything together
- Navigation and quick start guides
- Quality assurance procedures

**Validation:**
- Complete framework is usable by development teams
- Documentation provides clear entry points
- Quality procedures ensure systematic execution

**Time:** 1-2 hours

## Validation Between Stages

### Critical Checkpoints
After each stage, verify:
- **Completeness:** All required components generated
- **Consistency:** New content aligns with previous stages
- **Quality:** Content is detailed and actionable
- **Domain Alignment:** Generated content fits your specific business domain

### Common Issues
- **Vague specifications:** Re-run prompts with more specific domain details
- **Missing business rules:** Add domain-specific constraints and validation
- **Inconsistent patterns:** Ensure consistent naming and organizational approaches

---

## Final Framework Validation

### Complete Framework Should Include:
- Strategic planning documents for stakeholder communication
- Step-by-step implementation guides with validation
- Granular configuration files for AI-assisted generation
- Business rules documentation with implementation patterns
- Quality assurance framework with testing procedures

### Ready-to-Use Criteria:
- Development team can follow the generated process
- AI assistants can use configurations to generate working code
- Business rules are consistently enforced
- Quality gates prevent common development mistakes

---

## Customization After Generation

### Domain-Specific Adjustments:
- **Business rules:** Add domain-specific constraints and validation
- **Entity relationships:** Adjust for your specific data model
- **Authentication requirements:** Customize for your security needs
- **Integration patterns:** Adapt for your specific technical stack

### Team Adaptation:
- **Process refinement:** Adjust timelines and validation for team capabilities
- **Quality standards:** Customize quality gates for organizational requirements
- **Documentation style:** Adapt communication patterns for team preferences

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Generation Issues:
- **Incomplete configurations:** Review domain analysis, add missing business context
- **Inconsistent patterns:** Ensure consistent entity naming and organizational approach
- **Missing validation:** Add specific validation criteria for each development phase

### Quality Problems:
- **Too generic:** Add more domain-specific business rules and constraints
- **Too complex:** Simplify entity relationships, focus on core business logic
- **Poor organization:** Review existing NestJS examples, adjust organizational patterns
