# Lightweight Intent & Configuration Evolution Process

This process ensures traceability and alignment with business goals as you evolve intents and configuration in your Hybris B2C project.

---

## 1. Intent & Config Change Proposal
- Document new or changed business intent in a central config file (YAML/JSON).
- Include rationale, expected business outcome, and affected features/entities.

## 2. Review & Approval
- Use lightweight code reviews or a short async meeting with business and tech stakeholders.
- Confirm alignment with business goals and traceability to roadmap items.

## 3. Versioning & Change Log
- Version the config file (e.g., semantic versioning).
- Log each change with intent, author, date, and related business outcome.

## 4. Automated Impact Analysis
- Run a script or CI job to highlight affected code, tests, and integrations.
- Notify relevant teams of downstream impacts.

## 5. Regenerate & Validate
- Use AI/config-driven tools to regenerate code, tests, and documentation as needed.
- Run automated validation steps and quality gates.

## 6. Traceability Linkage
- Link config changes to business outcome tests and acceptance criteria.
- Update documentation and dashboards to reflect new/changed intents.

## 7. Continuous Feedback
- Gather feedback from business and tech teams after each release.
- Iterate quickly, updating config and intents as needed.
