Certainly! Here’s a set of **terse, actionable prompts** you can use with an AI agent to adjust and apply IDGL principles to your Pearson B2C Hybris project, tailored for your technical architect role:

---

### 1. Intent Definition

**Prompt:**  
“Given the Pearson B2C Hybris project, extract and list the top 5 business outcome intents from our current roadmap, each with a clear success criterion and context.”

---

### 2. Configuration Mapping

**Prompt:**  
“Analyze our Hybris extension structure and configuration files. Propose a unified, high-level configuration schema (YAML/JSON) that could drive code generation or validation for new features, entities, and integrations.”

---

### 3. Automation Opportunities

**Prompt:**  
“Identify repetitive or boilerplate-heavy tasks in our Hybris development (e.g., attribute handlers, impex scripts, FlexibleSearch queries). Suggest where AI-assisted or configuration-driven generation could be introduced for speed and consistency.”

---

### 4. Validation & Quality Gates

**Prompt:**  
“Define a set of automated validation steps and quality gates for each intent cycle, ensuring that generated or implemented features are immediately testable, integrated, and meet business outcomes.”

---

### 5. Intent Evolution

**Prompt:**  
“Recommend a lightweight process for evolving intents and configuration as requirements change, ensuring traceability and alignment with business goals.”

---

### 6. Documentation & Traceability

**Prompt:**  
“Propose a structure for living documentation that links each intent to its implementation artifacts (code, config, tests) and business validation, supporting auditability and onboarding.”

---

**How to use:**  
Copy/paste each prompt to your AI agent or assistant, one at a time, to drive systematic, IDGL-aligned transformation of your Hybris project.  
If you want these as a single compound prompt or need further tailoring, let me know!
