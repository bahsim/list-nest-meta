# Hybris Agentic Process (Draft)

A private, IDGL-inspired approach for intent-driven, traceable, and quality-focused development on the SAP Hybris platform.

---

## Overview

The Hybris Agentic Process adapts agentic (AI-assisted, intent-to-implementation) principles to the realities of the Hybris platform. It maximizes traceability, automation where feasible, and continuous alignment with business intentâ€”while respecting the platform's legacy, complexity, and manual integration needs.

## Guiding Principles
- **Intent-Driven:** All work is organized around clear business intents, captured in living documentation and configuration.
- **Selective Automation:** Automate repetitive, low-risk tasks (e.g., attribute handlers, impex, DTOs) using scripts, templates, or AI agents.
- **Manual Integration:** Core business logic, extension wiring, and complex integrations remain expert-driven but are always traceable to intent.
- **Quality Gates:** Every change passes automated and manual validation steps before release.
- **Traceability:** Every artifact (code, config, test) is linked to its originating intent.
- **Continuous Evolution:** The process, tooling, and documentation are iteratively improved as new automation opportunities arise.

## High-Level Phases
1. **Intent Capture & Documentation**
   - Define business outcomes, acceptance criteria, and affected features/entities.
   - Register intents in a central index (YAML/JSON).
2. **Design & Planning**
   - Map intents to implementation areas (manual vs. automatable).
   - Identify automation opportunities and manual integration points.
3. **Selective Code Generation & Scripting**
   - Use config-driven tools/AI to generate boilerplate (handlers, impex, DTOs, test skeletons).
   - Scaffold documentation and test cases.
4. **Manual Implementation & Integration**
   - Expert developers implement complex logic, integrations, and extension wiring.
   - All manual work is linked to intent and documented.
5. **Validation & Quality Gates**
   - Run automated and manual tests, static analysis, and business outcome validation.
   - Ensure traceability and documentation are up to date.
6. **Release & Feedback**
   - Deploy to test/production.
   - Gather feedback, update intents, and evolve process/tooling as needed.

## Roles
- **Business Stakeholder:** Defines business outcomes and priorities.
- **Technical Architect:** Maps intents to implementation, defines automation boundaries, and ensures traceability.
- **Developer:** Implements features (manual and automated), maintains traceability, and updates documentation.
- **QA/Validation:** Ensures all quality gates are met and business outcomes are validated.
- **AI/Automation Agent:** Generates code, scripts, and documentation for automatable areas.

---

## Automation Boundaries
- **Automated:** Attribute handlers, impex scripts, DTOs, test skeletons, documentation scaffolding.
- **Manual:** Core business logic, extension wiring, complex integrations, platform upgrades.

---

## Documentation Structure
- **Intent Registry:** Central index of all business intents and their status.
- **Intent Detail Pages:** Per-intent documentation linking to code, config, tests, and validation.
- **Artifact Linking:** Comments/annotations in code/config/tests referencing intent IDs.
- **Validation Reports:** Automated and manual test results linked to intents.
- **Change Log:** Versioned record of intent/config evolution.
- **Onboarding Guide:** How to navigate from business intent to implementation and validation.
