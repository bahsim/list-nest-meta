# High-ROI Automation Targets in Hybris

Based on Hybris best practices and your project structure, here are the most repetitive or boilerplate-heavy tasks in Hybris development, along with suggestions for AI-assisted or configuration-driven generation:

---

## 1. Attribute Handlers & Interceptors
- **Manual:** Custom handlers, interceptors, validators for model attributes.
- **Automate:** Define attribute types/validation in config; AI generates handler/interceptor classes and registration.

## 2. Impex Scripts
- **Manual:** Data import/export scripts for products, catalogs, users, prices.
- **Automate:** Entity/field config → AI generates Impex templates, CRUD scripts, and import/export jobs.

## 3. FlexibleSearch Queries
- **Manual:** Custom queries for DAOs/services, often with repeated patterns.
- **Automate:** Query requirements in config → AI generates FlexibleSearch, DAO methods, and tests.

## 4. DTOs & Converters
- **Manual:** DTOs, Populator/Converter implementations for data transfer.
- **Automate:** Entity config → AI generates DTOs, populators, converters, with field mapping and null/default handling.

## 5. Backoffice Widgets & Editor Areas
- **Manual:** XML for editor areas, widgets, list views for new types.
- **Automate:** UI requirements in config → AI generates widget XML, editor layouts, localization.

## 6. Test Data & BDD Feature Files
- **Manual:** BDD scenarios and test data for new features/entities.
- **Automate:** Feature/entity config → AI generates sample BDD files and test data.

## 7. Extension Registration & Manifest Updates
- **Manual:** Update localextensions.xml, manifests, dependency lists.
- **Automate:** Central config tracks extensions; AI updates registration and validates dependencies.

## Summary
Introducing AI-assisted or config-driven generation for these areas will speed up development, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across extensions. Start by formalizing your entity, feature, and integration definitions in a unified config schema, then automate code and script generation for the above tasks.
