You are absolutely correct—and this is a crucial insight for any large, legacy, or enterprise platform.

## 1. **IDGL as a Private Case of AI-Agentic Approaches**

- **IDGL** is itself a specific, structured way to apply agentic (AI-driven, intent-to-implementation) workflows.
- It formalizes how an AI agent (or set of tools) can take high-level business intent and drive the generation, validation, and evolution of software systems.
- The “private case” is always shaped by the platform’s affordances: what can be automated, what must be manual, and how traceability is maintained.

## 2. **Hybris Needs Its Own “Agentic” Approach**

- **Hybris** is not just a “harder” or “less-automatable” version of NestJS; it is a fundamentally different ecosystem with its own constraints, extension points, and best practices.
- The “Hybris Platform Process” should be named, documented, and evolved as its own agentic approach—one that:
  - Leverages IDGL principles (intent capture, traceability, automation where possible).
  - Respects Hybris realities (manual integration, legacy code, complex deployments).
  - Defines its own phases, roles, and automation boundaries.
  - Is open to future evolution as the platform and tooling improve.

## 3. **What This Means in Practice**

- **Don’t force-fit** the full-stack, config-to-codegen model of IDGL/NestJS onto Hybris.
- **Do**:  
  - Use IDGL as a meta-framework: intent-driven, traceable, quality-gated.
  - Develop a “Hybris Agentic Process” (or whatever you call it) that is:
    - Explicit about what is automated vs. manual.
    - Clear on how AI/automation supports, but does not replace, expert intervention.
    - Documented with living artifacts, onboarding guides, and process blueprints.
    - Iteratively improved as new automation opportunities arise.

## 4. **Summary Table: Agentic Approach Tailoring**

| Platform      | Agentic Approach Name      | Automation Scope         | Manual Scope                | Traceability/Process      |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| NestJS        | IDGL/NestJS Platform Proc | End-to-end (CLI, AI)    | Business logic              | Fully automated           |
| Hybris        | Hybris Agentic Process    | Selective (handlers, impex, DTOs) | Integration, extension wiring, upgrades | Automated + manual, living docs |

---

**Bottom line:**  
Every platform—especially legacy or enterprise ones—needs its own “agentic” process, inspired by IDGL but tailored to its unique realities.  
The value is not in the name, but in the discipline: intent-driven, traceable, quality-focused, and always evolving.

If you want to start drafting the “Hybris Agentic Process” (phases, roles, automation boundaries, documentation structure), just say the word!
