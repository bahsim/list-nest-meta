# General Rules for SAP Hybris Projects

These rules are designed to maximize maintainability, scalability, and alignment with modern software engineering and IDGL (Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle) principles. They are platform-agnostic and can be adapted to most Hybris projects, regardless of business domain.

---

## 1. Intent-Driven Development
- Organize work around clear, outcome-focused intents (e.g., “Enable guest checkout for all markets”), not just technical tasks.
- Document the business outcome, success criteria, and context for each major feature or change.
- Regularly review and refine intents as requirements evolve.

## 2. Configuration Over Customization
- Prefer configuration (via items.xml, impex, backoffice, etc.) over custom code wherever possible.
- Use Hybris’ extension and module system to encapsulate customizations, keeping the core platform untouched.
- Centralize environment-specific settings in property files and document overrides.

## 3. Code Quality and Standards
- Adhere to established coding standards (naming, formatting, documentation, etc.).
- Enforce code reviews and automated static analysis (e.g., SonarQube, Checkstyle).
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code—avoid “magic” or tribal knowledge.

## 4. Modularization and Reuse
- Structure code into logical, reusable extensions and modules.
- Leverage shared libraries and avoid code duplication.
- Use interfaces and dependency injection to decouple components.

## 5. Testing and Validation
- Implement automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all custom logic.
- Use test data and mocks for local development and CI pipelines.
- Validate all changes in a staging environment before production deployment.

## 6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
- Maintain up-to-date technical and business documentation (architecture, data models, user flows).
- Document all custom extensions, integrations, and key configuration points.
- Use diagrams (ER, sequence, flowcharts) to clarify complex logic and integrations.

## 7. Version Control and CI/CD
- Use Git (or equivalent) for all code, configuration, and scripts.
- Keep submodules and dependencies up to date and documented.
- Automate builds, tests, and deployments using CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.).

## 8. Performance and Scalability
- Profile and optimize critical code paths (e.g., FlexibleSearch queries, cronjobs).
- Use caching, indexing, and asynchronous processing where appropriate.
- Monitor system health and performance in production (logs, metrics, alerts).

## 9. Security and Compliance
- Secure sensitive data (e.g., user info, payment data) at rest and in transit.
- Apply least-privilege principles to user roles and integrations.
- Stay compliant with relevant regulations (GDPR, PCI DSS, etc.).

## 10. Change Management and Rollback
- Use feature toggles or configuration flags for risky changes.
- Maintain clear rollback procedures and backup strategies.
- Communicate changes to all stakeholders and provide training as needed.

## 11. Integration and Extensibility
- Use Hybris’ APIs (OCC, REST, SOAP) for integrations—avoid direct DB access.
- Document all integration points and data flows.
- Design for extensibility: anticipate future requirements and avoid hard-coding.

## 12. Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review processes, code, and architecture for improvement opportunities.
- Encourage feedback from all team members and stakeholders.
- Invest in automation, refactoring, and technical debt reduction.

### IDGL Alignment (Optional, for Modern Teams)
- Treat intents as living documents, evolving with business needs.
- Use configuration-driven or AI-assisted generation for repetitive tasks (e.g., new product types, APIs).
- Validate all work against business outcomes, not just technical completion.
