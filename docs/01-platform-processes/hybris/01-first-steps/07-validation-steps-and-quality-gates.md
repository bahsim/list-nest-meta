# Automated Validation Steps & Quality Gates

These steps ensure that every generated or implemented feature in the Hybris B2C project is immediately testable, integrated, and delivers business value.

---

## 1. Schema Validation
- Validate feature/entity/integration config against the unified schema.
- **Fail:** If required fields, types, or relationships are missing.

## 2. Code Generation Consistency
- Check that generated code (models, handlers, DAOs, DTOs, Impex, etc.) matches config definitions.
- **Fail:** If discrepancies or missing artifacts are detected.

## 3. Compilation & Static Analysis
- Run a full build (`ant clean all`, Gradle, etc.).
- Run static code analysis (SonarQube, PMD, Checkstyle).
- **Fail:** On compilation errors or critical static analysis issues.

## 4. Automated Unit & Integration Tests
- Generate and execute unit tests for new features/entities.
- Run integration tests (service layer, FlexibleSearch, Impex import/export).
- **Fail:** If coverage is below threshold or tests fail.

## 5. BDD/Acceptance Test Execution
- Generate or update BDD feature files for business outcome validation.
- Run automated acceptance tests (Cucumber, JUnit, etc.).
- **Fail:** If business outcome scenarios do not pass.

## 6. Impex/Data Import Validation
- Validate Impex scripts for syntax and test import/export in a sandbox.
- **Fail:** If import/export jobs do not complete successfully.

## 7. Backoffice/UI Verification
- Check that Backoffice widgets/editor areas are registered and functional.
- Run UI smoke tests for new/updated features.

## 8. Integration & Dependency Checks
- Validate extension registration (localextensions.xml, manifest).
- Check for missing or conflicting dependencies.

## 9. Documentation & Commit Quality
- Ensure generated/updated documentation matches feature intent.
- Validate commit messages and changelogs against standards.

## 10. Business Outcome Gate
- Confirm that the feature delivers the defined business outcome (e.g., product visibility, cart restoration, navigation).
- **Fail:** If outcome cannot be demonstrated in test or acceptance environment.

**Summary:**
Automate these steps in your CI/CD pipeline. Each feature/intent cycle must pass all gates before merging or release. This guarantees immediate testability, integration, and alignment with business goals.
