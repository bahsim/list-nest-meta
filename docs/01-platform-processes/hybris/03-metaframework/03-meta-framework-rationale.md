> **Type:** Rationale & Strategy

> **Status:** Draft (Foundational Document)  
> **Purpose:** Explain the necessity and approach for a meta-framework to manage, refactor, and migrate complex legacy platforms

## Why Direct Refactoring is Infeasible

- **Extreme Complexity:** Legacy platforms (e.g., Hybris) consist of thousands of classes, deeply coupled modules, and sprawling configuration files. Manual refactoring is slow, risky, and error-prone.
- **Opaque Dependencies:** Relationships are often hidden in configuration (e.g., Spring beans, XML), making it hard to trace impact or safely change code.
- **Business Criticality:** These systems run core business processes—mistakes can have severe consequences.
- **AI/Agent Limitations:** Even advanced AI tools struggle to operate effectively without explicit context and mapping.

## Why a Meta-Framework is Needed

- **Systematic Management:** A meta-framework provides a structured way to map, analyze, and orchestrate change across the entire platform.
- **Traceability:** Enables tracking of every artifact (module, file, config, method) and their relationships, supporting safe, incremental change.
- **Migration & Modernization:** Facilitates planning and execution of migrations to modern platforms or architectures.
- **Knowledge Capture:** Serves as a living map and documentation system, supporting onboarding, maintenance, and risk management.

## Benefits of a Meta-Framework

- **Reduces Risk:** Changes are planned and validated with full knowledge of dependencies and impact.
- **Enables Automation:** Supports automated analysis, visualization, and even code transformation.
- **Improves Onboarding:** New team members can navigate the system via the meta-framework’s map and metadata.
- **Supports AI/Agent Collaboration:** Provides the explicit context needed for AI-assisted development and refactoring.

## High-Level Steps to Build the Meta-Framework

### 1. Systematic Classification
- **Subsystems:** Catalog all major subsystems (e.g., storefront, order processing).
- **Modules:** List all modules/extensions and their boundaries.
- **Files:** Inventory all files within each module, noting type (Java, XML, Impex, etc.).
- **Inner Units:** For each file, extract inner units (classes, methods, beans, etc.).

### 2. Dependency & Relationship Mapping
- **Module Dependencies:** Parse configs (e.g., extensioninfo.xml, Spring) to map module dependencies.
- **Class/Bean Relationships:** Map interface-to-implementation bindings, bean injections, and event listeners.
- **File-Level Links:** Track imports, references, and cross-file calls.

### 3. Metadata Extraction
- For each node, extract:
  - Type (class, config, data, etc.)
  - Ownership (team, business domain)
  - Change frequency (from VCS)
  - Known issues or TODOs
  - Documentation links

### 4. Build the System Graph
- Represent the system as a graph:
  - **Nodes:** subsystems, modules, files, inner units
  - **Edges:** dependencies, references, configuration links
  - **Metadata:** attached to each node/edge

### 5. Enable Querying and Visualization
- Build tools to query and visualize the graph, trace impact, and plan safe changes.

## Next Steps

1. **Automated Inventory:** Start with scripts to crawl the codebase and config files, building the initial inventory.
2. **Dependency Extraction:** Parse configs and code to build the first dependency map.
3. **Metadata Collection:** Gather ownership, documentation, and change history for each node.
4. **Graph Construction:** Use a graph database or in-memory model to represent the system.
5. **Pilot Visualization:** Build a simple UI or CLI to explore the graph and answer key questions.
