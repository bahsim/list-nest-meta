Of course. It is wise to step back and ensure we have a shared, concrete vision of the final product before proceeding. My apologies for moving to the plan prematurely.

Let's define the end solution in detail.

### **End Solution: The "List-Nest" Code Reuse Assistant**

This tool will be a command-line utility and CI bot designed to integrate seamlessly into a developer's workflow. Its sole purpose is to understand the entire React codebase, identify reusable patterns, and proactively prevent developers from inadvertently creating duplicate logic.

#### **Core User Experience & Workflows**

**1. For the Developer (Local Assistance)**

A developer, after writing a new component, hook, or utility, can instantly check if their work overlaps with existing code.

*   **Command:** `npm run suggester:analyze <path/to/new-file.tsx>`
*   **Interaction:** The tool runs in seconds and provides direct feedback in the terminal.

**Mockup of CLI Output:**

```
$ npm run suggester:analyze src/components/AuthorDetails.tsx

Analyzing src/components/AuthorDetails.tsx...
Found potential code reuse opportunities:

Suggestion: High Similarity (92%)
  Your new component 'AuthorDetails' is very similar to the existing component 'UserProfileCard'.

  [ Existing Code ]
  - Name: UserProfileCard
  - Path: src/components/cards/UserProfileCard.tsx
  - Description: Displays a user's profile information in a card format.

  [ Your New Code ]
  - Name: AuthorDetails
  - Props: { authorId: string, showAvatar: boolean }

Consider reusing 'UserProfileCard' to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.
```

**2. For the Team (Automated CI Guardrail)**

The tool will be configured to run automatically on every pull request, acting as an impartial reviewer that safeguards the codebase quality.

*   **Trigger:** A GitHub Action (or other CI job) is triggered when a pull request is opened or updated.
*   **Action:** The tool scans the changed files (`git diff`) and posts a comment if it finds significant duplication.

**Mockup of an Automated PR Comment:**

#### **Technical Architecture & Metadata Structure**

The system is composed of two main parts: the analysis engine and the metadata it relies on.

**1. Analysis Engine (`scripts/code-reuse-suggester`)**

*   **CLI Interface (`commander.js`):** Provides the user-facing commands:
    *   `generate-metadata <project_path>`: Scans the entire project to create/update the metadata. This runs on every merge to `main`.
    *   `analyze <file_path>`: Analyzes a single file against the metadata store. This runs locally or on PRs.
*   **AST Parser (`ts-morph`):** It will precisely deconstruct TypeScript code into a structured format, extracting:
    *   **Components:** Name, props (with names and types), and JSDoc description.
    *   **Hooks:** Name, arguments, return signature, and JSDoc description.
    *   **Utilities:** Function name, parameters, and return type.
*   **Similarity Engine:** It uses a two-factor scoring system:
    1.  **Structural Similarity:** Compares the AST-derived signatures. For components, it might check the percentage of overlapping prop names and types.
    2.  **Semantic Similarity:** Compares the one-sentence descriptions (from JSDoc or an LLM) using string-similarity algorithms to catch components that are functionally similar even if named differently.

**2. Metadata Store (`/metadata/*.json`)**

This is the "brain" of the tool. It's a collection of small, human-readable JSON files, split by entity type for clarity and performance.

**Example `metadata/components.json`:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "UserProfileCard-src/components/cards/UserProfileCard.tsx",
    "filePath": "src/components/cards/UserProfileCard.tsx",
    "name": "UserProfileCard",
    "props": [
      { "name": "userId", "type": "string" },
      { "name": "showAvatar", "type": "boolean" },
      { "name": "onClick", "type": "() => void" }
    ],
    "description": "Displays a user's profile information in a card format.",
    "hash": "a1b2c3d4..." // A hash of the component's structure to detect changes
  }
]
```
**Example `metadata/hooks.json`:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "useApiData-src/hooks/useApiData.ts",
    "filePath": "src/hooks/useApiData.ts",
    "name": "useApiData",
    "signature": "(url: string) => { data: T | null; isLoading: boolean; error: Error | null; }",
    "description": "A generic hook to fetch data from an API endpoint.",
    "hash": "e5f6g7h8..."
  }
]
```

This detailed vision describes a tangible, valuable tool that addresses the prompt's requirements directly. It provides immediate value to developers locally and enforces standards automatically for the entire team.

Does this detailed vision of the end solution align with your goals? If you approve, I am ready to begin with the implementation plan I outlined previously.
