You're looking to build a powerful Code Reuse Suggestion Tool for React, aiming to prevent code duplication and promote consistency. This is a fantastic goal, as it can significantly improve code quality and development efficiency.
Here's a breakdown of how you can approach building this tool, incorporating your requirements and suggestions:
Code Reuse Suggestion Tool: Architecture and Implementation
### 1. Metadata Preparation: The Brains of the Operation
This is the core of your tool. The quality and comprehensiveness of your metadata will directly impact the effectiveness of your suggestions.
What to store:
 * Component Metadata:
   * name: Component name (e.g., Button, Modal).
   * filePath: Path to the component file.
   * propsSignature: Type signature of its props (e.g., { onClick: () => void, label: string }).
   * description: A brief description of its purpose.
   * usageExamples: Snippets showing how it's typically used.
   * dependencies: Other components or hooks it uses.
 * Hook Metadata:
   * name: Hook name (e.g., useToggle, useDebounce).
   * filePath: Path to the hook file.
   * signature: Function signature (input/output types).
   * description: What it does.
   * usageExamples: How to use it.
 * Utility Function Metadata:
   * name: Function name (e.g., formatDate, deepClone).
   * filePath: Path to the utility file.
   * signature: Function signature.
   * description: Its purpose.
   * usageExamples: How it's used.
 * Generic Code Patterns: For common logic blocks that might not be a full component or hook, consider extracting:
   * patternHash: A hash of the code structure (to detect exact duplicates).
   * abstractedSignature: A more generic representation of the pattern.
   * description: What this pattern achieves.
How to store it:
 * JSON files: Simple for smaller codebases, easy to read and manage with scripts. You could have separate JSON files for components, hooks, and utilities, or one large file.
 * SQLite database: Excellent for larger codebases. It's lightweight, embedded, and provides SQL for more complex queries and indexing, which will be crucial for efficient searching. This is generally recommended for performance and scalability.
Updating Metadata (CI/CD Integration):
 * Trigger: On every git push to your main branch or a successful merge into main (or develop).
 * Process:
   * Analyze Diffs: Use git diff to identify changed and new files.
   * AST Parsing (TypeScript AST): This is the most reliable way to extract signatures and patterns from TypeScript/JavaScript files. Libraries like @typescript-eslint/typescript-estree can parse your code into an Abstract Syntax Tree.
   * Pattern Extraction Logic:
     * Components: Look for JSX elements, export default function or export const declarations returning JSX, and analyze their props interfaces/types.
     * Hooks: Look for functions starting with use and analyze their input/output types.
     * Utilities: Analyze exported functions.
     * Semantic Analysis: For more advanced pattern matching, you might compute a "similarity hash" or a simplified representation of the function's logic flow.
   * Update/Insert/Delete:
     * If a file is new, extract its patterns and add them to the metadata.
     * If a file is changed, re-extract its patterns and update the existing entries.
     * If a file is deleted, remove its corresponding metadata entries.
### 2. Code Authoring Assistance: Real-Time Suggestions
This is where the developer gets direct value.
How it works:
 * Trigger: As the developer types in their IDE (on save, or even real-time with an IDE plugin).
 * Extract New Code Pattern:
   * IDE Plugin: The plugin would have access to the currently open file and can extract the AST of the code being written.
   * CLI Mode: The developer explicitly runs a command on a file.
   * AI/LLM (for semantic understanding): For more nuanced similarity, an LLM could analyze the description or even the code logic itself to suggest similar abstractions, even if the exact signature doesn't match. This is particularly useful for "conceptual" reuse.
 * Search Metadata:
   * Signature Matching: First, prioritize exact or near-exact signature matches (e.g., a hook (id: string) => { data: T, loading: boolean } matching an existing one).
   * Structural Similarity: For code blocks that aren't a clear component/hook/utility, compute a simplified structural representation (e.g., control flow graph, hash of simplified AST) and compare it against existing patterns in your metadata.
   * Semantic Similarity (LLM): If basic matching fails, pass a description of the new code's intent or a simplified version of its logic to an LLM to find semantically similar existing patterns from your metadata.
 * Suggestion: If a match is found, present it to the developer:
   * "It looks like you're implementing a similar feature to useAuth in src/hooks/useAuth.ts. Consider reusing it."
   * "This button component (<MyButton />) has similar props to components/core/Button.tsx. Consider using Button instead."
   * Provide the path to the existing code and a brief description.
### 3. CI/CD Integration: The Gatekeeper
This ensures quality at the team level.
How it works:
 * Trigger: On every Pull Request creation or update.
 * Scan Diff: Use git diff --cached (for pre-commit hooks) or git diff <base-branch> <head-branch> (for PRs) to identify all changes.
 * Pattern Extraction & Comparison: For every new or modified code block in the diff:
   * Extract its pattern/signature.
   * Compare it against your entire metadata store.
   * If a high-confidence duplication or similar pattern is found, flag it.
 * Comment on PR:
   * Use your CI/CD platform's API (e.g., GitHub API, GitLab API) to add comments directly to the PR.
   * "Duplication Alert: The logic in src/newFeature/MyNewComponent.tsx appears similar to components/shared/ExistingWidget.tsx. Consider reusing ExistingWidget."
   * Include a link to the suggested file and potentially a diff highlighting the similar sections.
 * Metadata Update: After a successful merge into main (or equivalent), trigger the metadata preparation step (as described in section 1) to update the store with the newly merged code.
### 4. Extensibility: Adaptability is Key
 * Modular Design: Structure your tool into distinct modules:
   * metadata-manager.ts: Handles reading, writing, and updating the metadata store.
   * code-parser.ts: Encapsulates AST parsing and pattern extraction logic.
   * similarity-engine.ts: Contains the logic for comparing new code patterns with existing metadata (including potential LLM integration).
   * suggester.ts: Formats and delivers suggestions.
 * CLI Mode: A command-line interface cli.ts that uses the core modules.
   * code-reuse scan <file-path>: Scans a specific file and outputs suggestions.
   * code-reuse update-metadata: Triggers a full metadata update.
 * IDE Plugin: Develop a VS Code extension or similar. This would integrate code-parser and similarity-engine directly into the editor.
 * CI/CD Bot: A ci-bot.ts script that runs in your CI environment, interacts with git and your SCM provider's API, and uses the core modules to scan PRs and post comments.
 * Local/Secure Server Analysis:
   * All code analysis should happen within your environment.
   * If using an LLM for semantic similarity, ensure it's either an on-premise model or a highly secure, enterprise-grade cloud service where data privacy is guaranteed. For sensitive code, consider fine-tuning a small, local LLM.
Implementation Hints
 * TypeScript Scripts: Absolutely, use TypeScript for all logic. It provides type safety and better maintainability.
   * AST Parsing: ts-morph is an excellent library built on top of TypeScript's compiler API, making it easier to navigate and manipulate ASTs.
 * Shell Scripts: For orchestrating the CI/CD steps (e.g., triggering git diff, calling your TypeScript scripts).
 * AI/LLM for Semantic Similarity:
   * Vector Embeddings: A powerful technique. You could generate embeddings (numerical representations) for your existing code patterns (e.g., using a pre-trained code model like CodeBERT or even a general-purpose embedding model from OpenAI/Google's API). When a new pattern comes in, generate its embedding and find the nearest neighbors in your embedding space.
   * Local LLMs: Explore models like Llama.cpp for running smaller LLMs locally for embedding generation or simple similarity checks.
 * Metadata Storage: Start with JSON and consider migrating to SQLite if performance becomes an issue.
   * For SQLite, use a library like better-sqlite3 (for Node.js).
 * Git Hooks: For pre-commit checks, use husky to easily manage Git hooks and trigger your CLI tool before a commit.
This tool will be a significant asset to your React codebase, promoting cleaner, more maintainable code and fostering a culture of reuse within your development team. Good luck!
