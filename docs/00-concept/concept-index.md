# IDGL Concept Foundation

> **Type:** Navigation Index  
> **Category:** Core Framework  
> **Status:** Draft  
> **Purpose:** Foundational IDGL concepts that serve as evaluation criteria

---

## Purpose

This directory contains the **foundational conceptual definitions** of IDGL that serve as criteria for evaluating all other documentation, processes, and implementations. These documents establish **what IDGL is** independent of how to implement it.

## Conceptual Documents

### **Core Framework** (Read in Order)

1. **[IDGL Definition](./idgl-definition.md)**
   - **What it is**: Canonical definition of Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle
   - **Purpose**: Establishes what IDGL is and what it is NOT
   - **Use as**: Evaluation criteria for any IDGL-related content

2. **[IDGL Philosophy](./idgl-philosophy.md)**
   - **What it is**: Foundational principles and mindset
   - **Purpose**: Guides how IDGL should be approached and implemented
   - **Use as**: Decision-making framework for IDGL work

3. **[IDGL Methodology](./idgl-methodology.md)**
   - **What it is**: Systematic approaches for implementation
   - **Purpose**: Bridges philosophy with practical implementation
   - **Use as**: Framework for developing specific processes
   - **Includes**: Fullstack Developer + AI Assistant Partnership patterns

## How to Use These Documents

### **For Evaluation**
Use these documents to assess whether any claimed "IDGL" process, tool, or implementation actually aligns with IDGL principles:

**Questions to Ask:**
- Does this approach organize work around outcome-focused intents?
- Does this leverage AI for comprehensive generation rather than fragmented assistance?
- Does this preserve human strategic responsibility while enabling AI tactical execution?
- Does this support intent evolution based on learning?

### **For Implementation**
Use these documents as the foundation for creating platform-specific processes:

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. **Start with Concept**: Understand the foundational principles
2. **Develop Process**: Create specific methodology for your platform/context
3. **Create Templates**: Build reusable patterns that embody the principles
4. **Generate Examples**: Show the principles in action

### **For Documentation**
Use these documents as criteria for evaluating and improving existing documentation:

**Documentation Audit Questions:**
- Does this document support or contradict IDGL principles?
- Does this process fragment work or maintain intent coherence?
- Does this treat AI as tactical executor or micro-managed tool?
- Does this preserve strategic human responsibility?

## Success Indicators

### **Conceptual Foundation is Working When:**
- Teams can clearly articulate what IDGL is without referencing specific tools
- Implementation decisions are evaluated against consistent philosophical principles
- New processes naturally align with IDGL characteristics
- Conflicts between approaches can be resolved by referring to foundational principles

### **Conceptual Foundation Needs Work When:**
- Different team members have contradictory understanding of IDGL
- Implementation decisions are driven by tool capabilities rather than strategic intent
- Processes are called "IDGL" but contradict core principles
- Confusion exists about the relationship between human and AI responsibilities

## Relationship to Other Documentation

### **Drives Platform Processes**
The concepts in this directory should inform all platform-specific processes in [platform-processes/](../platform-processes/). Every platform process should be evaluable against these foundational principles.

### **Informs Templates**
All templates in [templates/](../templates/) should embody these conceptual principles. Templates are practical expressions of the foundational concepts.

### **Guides Examples**
Examples in [examples/](../examples/) should demonstrate these principles in action. Examples should clarify how the concepts work in practice.

### **Shapes Principles**
More specific principles in [principles/](../principles/) should build upon and extend these foundational concepts without contradicting them.

## Document Evolution

### **When to Update Concepts**
These foundational documents should be stable, but may need updates when:
- Fundamental misunderstandings are discovered in how IDGL is defined
- Practical experience reveals gaps in the conceptual framework
- New insights emerge about the relationship between human strategic direction and AI tactical execution

### **How to Update Concepts**
1. **Document the Problem**: What current limitation or misunderstanding needs addressing?
2. **Assess Impact**: How would changes affect existing implementations and documentation?
3. **Validate Change**: Does the proposed change improve clarity without contradicting successful practices?
4. **Update Consistently**: Ensure all three documents remain coherent with each other
5. **Cascade Changes**: Update dependent documentation to align with conceptual changes

## Quality Assurance

### **Internal Consistency**
- All three conceptual documents should present a coherent, non-contradictory view of IDGL
- Terminology should be consistent across documents
- Examples should align with stated principles

### **External Validation**
- These concepts should be testable against real implementations
- Success indicators should be observable in practice
- Principles should provide useful guidance for resolving implementation conflicts

**Next Steps**: After reading these conceptual foundations, explore specific implementations in [platform-processes/](../platform-processes/) or see practical patterns in [templates/](../templates/).
