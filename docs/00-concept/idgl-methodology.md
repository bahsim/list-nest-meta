## Implementation Lifecycle

### **Phase 1: Intent Formation**

**Purpose**: Establish clear, outcome-focused intentions that guide all subsequent work.

#### **Intent Definition Process**
1. **Outcome Articulation**: What specific, demonstrable result do we want to achieve?
2. **Success Criteria**: How will we know the intent has been fulfilled?
3. **Strategic Context**: Why does this outcome matter? What business or technical need does it serve?
4. **Constraint Identification**: What limitations or requirements must be respected?
5. **Assumption Documentation**: What are we assuming to be true?

#### **Intent Quality Gates**
- [ ] **Demonstrable**: Can success be shown through working functionality?
- [ ] **Complete**: Does the intent encompass a coherent, valuable outcome?
- [ ] **Strategic**: Does this align with broader project objectives?
- [ ] **Achievable**: Is this realistic given current constraints?
- [ ] **Measurable**: Can success/failure be objectively determined?

#### **Example Intent Structure**
```
**Intent**: Create user authentication system
**Outcome**: Users can securely log in and access role-appropriate features
**Success Criteria**: 
- Users authenticate with email/password
- Role-based access controls function correctly
- Session management works across browser sessions
- System handles 1000+ concurrent users
**Context**: Foundation for all user-specific features
**Constraints**: Must integrate with existing user database
**Assumptions**: Email-based authentication preferred by users
```

### **Phase 2: Solution Generation**

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive solutions that fulfill the defined intent.

#### **Generation Approach**
1. **Context Provision**: Provide AI with complete intent, constraints, and strategic context
2. **Comprehensive Request**: Ask for complete, functional solutions rather than fragments
3. **Alternative Exploration**: Request multiple approaches when trade-offs exist
4. **Integration Consideration**: Ensure solutions work within existing system architecture

#### **AI Prompt Structure**
```
**Intent**: [Complete intent statement from Phase 1]
**Context**: [Current system state, architectural patterns, technology stack]
**Request**: Generate a complete implementation that fulfills this intent
**Requirements**: 
- Working code that can be immediately tested
- Proper error handling and edge cases
- Integration with existing systems
- Performance considerations for scale requirements
**Alternatives**: Please suggest 2-3 different approaches if significant trade-offs exist
```

#### **Generation Quality Gates**
- [ ] **Complete**: Can the solution be implemented and tested immediately?
- [ ] **Functional**: Does it demonstrably fulfill the intent?
- [ ] **Integrated**: Does it work within existing system architecture?
- [ ] **Robust**: Does it handle errors and edge cases appropriately?
- [ ] **Scalable**: Does it meet performance and scale requirements?

### **Phase 3: Validation & Refinement**

**Purpose**: Ensure generated solutions align with strategic intent and refine as needed.

#### **Validation Process**
1. **Strategic Alignment**: Does the solution achieve the stated intent?
2. **Technical Assessment**: Is the implementation sound and maintainable?
3. **Integration Testing**: Does it work correctly within the broader system?
4. **Performance Validation**: Does it meet scale and performance requirements?
5. **Future Adaptability**: Can this evolve with changing requirements?

#### **Refinement Triggers**
- **Intent Misalignment**: Solution doesn't fulfill the strategic outcome
- **Technical Issues**: Implementation has significant flaws or limitations
- **Integration Problems**: Solution doesn't work with existing systems
- **Performance Gaps**: Solution doesn't meet scale requirements
- **Learning Evolution**: New understanding suggests better approaches

#### **Refinement Process**
1. **Issue Identification**: What specifically needs adjustment?
2. **Intent Review**: Does the intent need evolution based on learning?
3. **Solution Adjustment**: How should the implementation change?
4. **Re-validation**: Does the refined solution address all concerns?

## Continuous Practices

### **Intent Evolution Management**

#### **When to Evolve Intent**
- Implementation reveals better approaches to the same outcome
- Business requirements change affecting success criteria
- Technical constraints require different solutions
- User feedback suggests different value priorities

#### **How to Evolve Intent**
1. **Document Learning**: What new information triggered the need for evolution?
2. **Strategic Re-assessment**: How does new information affect strategic goals?
3. **Intent Revision**: Update intent to reflect improved understanding
4. **Impact Analysis**: How does this change affect related intents?
5. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure strategic direction remains coherent

### **AI Collaboration Patterns**

#### **Effective AI Interaction**
- **Provide Strategic Context**: Help AI understand the business purpose
- **Request Complete Solutions**: Ask for functional, testable implementations
- **Validate Strategic Alignment**: Ensure AI solutions serve business intent
- **Leverage AI for Alternatives**: Use AI to explore different implementation approaches
- **Maintain Human Judgment**: Make strategic decisions based on AI input

#### **AI Collaboration Anti-Patterns**
- **Micro-Managing AI**: Providing overly detailed implementation instructions
- **Abdicating Strategy**: Letting AI make strategic business decisions
- **Fragment Assembly**: Accepting code snippets requiring extensive integration
- **Context Starvation**: Not providing sufficient strategic context
- **Solution Acceptance**: Implementing AI suggestions without strategic validation
