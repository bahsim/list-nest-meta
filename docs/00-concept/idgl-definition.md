## What IDGL Is

**Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL)** is a software development framework that organizes work around **outcome-focused intentions** rather than task lists, leveraging **AI-assisted generation** and **human strategic guidance** through iterative cycles.

### **Core Components**

#### **Intent-Driven**
- Work is organized around **clear outcome statements** (intents)
- Each intent describes **what should be achieved**, not just what should be built
- Intents are **living documents** that evolve with understanding
- Strategic decisions flow from intent alignment, not process compliance

#### **Generative**
- **AI assists in generating** comprehensive solutions from intent descriptions
- **Human provides strategic direction** and validates outcomes
- **Multiple execution methods** (AI, scripts, templates, manual) produce equivalent results
- Generation is **complete and functional**, not fragmentary

#### **Lifecycle**
- **Iterative cycles** of Intent → Analysis → Generation → Review → Refinement
- Each cycle produces **demonstrable, working results**
- **Continuous alignment** between vision and implementation
- **Adaptive planning** based on learning from each cycle

## What IDGL Is NOT

### **Not Task Management**
- IDGL is not about breaking work into smaller tasks
- Not a project management methodology
- Not focused on time tracking or resource allocation

### **Not Pure AI Automation**
- Human strategic judgment remains central
- AI assists but does not replace human decision-making
- Process requires human validation and course correction

### **Not Rigid Process**
- No mandatory tools or specific software requirements
- Adaptable to different team sizes and contexts
- Flexible execution methods based on situation

## Core Distinctions

### **IDGL vs. Traditional Approaches**

| Aspect | Traditional Approach | IDGL Approach |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Organization** | Tasks and sprints | Outcome-focused intents |
| **Planning** | Upfront detailed planning | Adaptive planning from intents |
| **AI Role** | Tool for specific tasks | Strategic partner in generation |
| **Human Role** | Task executor | Strategic director and validator |
| **Output** | Completed tasks | Working, demonstrable results |
| **Adaptation** | Change management process | Continuous intent refinement |

## Success Indicators

### **IDGL is Working When:**
- Teams can articulate clear intents for all major work
- Generated solutions align with stated intents
- AI assistance accelerates rather than complicates work
- Iterations produce increasingly valuable outcomes
- Strategic vision remains coherent throughout development

### **IDGL is Failing When:**
- Process becomes more important than outcomes
- Intents become static requirement documents
- AI generates solutions that miss the strategic intent
- Human decision-making is outsourced to process or AI
- Work fragments into disconnected task execution

## Scope and Applicability

### **Where IDGL Applies**
- Software development projects with strategic ambiguity
- Teams leveraging AI-assisted development
- Contexts requiring rapid adaptation and learning
- Projects where outcome clarity matters more than process predictability

### **Where IDGL May Not Fit**
- Highly regulated environments requiring specific process compliance
- Teams without access to AI assistance capabilities
- Projects with completely fixed requirements and timelines
- Contexts prioritizing predictability over adaptability

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

### **Complements**
- **Agile methodologies**: IDGL can work within sprints and iterations
- **Design thinking**: Intent formation aligns with problem definition
- **DevOps practices**: Generation output integrates with CI/CD pipelines

### **Differs From**
- **Waterfall**: No sequential phases, continuous iteration
- **Pure Agile**: Focus on intents rather than user stories
- **Kanban**: Organization by outcomes, not workflow states

## Implementation Note

This definition establishes **what IDGL is conceptually**. Implementation guidance, methodologies, and specific practices are documented separately and should align with these core definitions.

**Validation Criteria**: All IDGL-related documentation, processes, and practices should be evaluable against this definition. If something claims to be "IDGL" but contradicts these core characteristics, it represents either a misunderstanding or an evolution of the framework that requires explicit discussion.
