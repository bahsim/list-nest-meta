## Purpose
This document outlines how to approach UI/UX design in the era of AI-assisted development, specifically for intent-driven, modular projects like this one. It provides principles, actionable steps, and process recommendations to ensure that user experience is always traceable to user intent, leveraging AI as a design partner while maintaining human oversight and design system consistency.

## 1. Principles for AI-Assisted UI/UX Design

### Intent-Driven Design
- **Start with Intents:** Use intent documentation as the primary source for user needs, flows, and edge cases.
- **Traceability:** Map every UI/UX element to a user intent or deliverable.
- **Living Documentation:** Keep UI/UX requirements in sync with evolving intents, using AI to parse and highlight changes.

### AI as a Design Partner
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Use AI tools to generate wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes from intent docs.
- **User Flow Generation:** Leverage AI to suggest user flows, edge cases, and accessibility improvements.
- **Consistency Checks:** Use AI to review design files or code for consistency with design systems and intent deliverables.

### Human-in-the-Loop
- **Review and Refine:** All AI-generated assets must be reviewed and refined by the solo developer. Use checklists and intent docs to ensure completeness.
- **Feedback Loops:** Use AI to collect and summarize user feedback, feeding it back into the intent and design process.
- **Solo-Dev Note:** In the absence of a dedicated design team, the solo developer acts as both reviewer and implementer, leveraging AI for iterative refinement and validation.

## 2. Process for UI/UX Design

### a. From Intents to Wireframes
1. **Extract Flows:** For each intent, extract required user flows and states.
2. **AI-Generated Wireframes:** Use AI tools to generate initial wireframes.
3. **Solo-Dev Review:** Critically assess and iterate on AI-generated wireframes for accessibility, branding, usability, and completeness. Use checklists and intent docs for validation.

### b. Component-Driven Development
- **FSD/FCA Structure:** Build UI as composable, reusable components, colocated by feature.
- **AI-Assisted Component Generation:** Use AI to scaffold component code, documentation, and tests from wireframes and intent docs.
- **Design System Enforcement:** Use AI to check for adherence to the design system (e.g., MUI, SCSS modules).

### c. Prototyping and User Testing
- **Interactive Prototypes:** Generate interactive prototypes for user testing, using AI to simulate flows and edge cases.
- **AI-Driven Usability Testing:** Use AI to analyze user test sessions and suggest improvements.

### d. Continuous Alignment
- **Sync with Intents:** Regularly use AI to compare the current UI/UX implementation with the latest intent docs.
- **Automated Documentation:** Use AI to generate and update user-facing documentation as the UI evolves.

## 3. AI-Enhanced UI/UX Deliverables
- **Intent-to-UI Traceability Matrix:** Mapping of UI screens/components to intents and deliverables.
- **Edge Case Coverage Reports:** AI-generated reports on which edge cases are covered by the current UI.
- **Accessibility Audits:** Automated, AI-powered accessibility checks in CI/CD.
- **Personalization and Adaptivity:** Use AI to suggest or implement adaptive UI elements based on user preferences and behavior.

## 4. Operationalizing AI-Assisted UI/UX

1. **For Each Epic/Intent:**
   - Extract user flows, states, and edge cases.
   - Use AI to generate wireframes and flow diagrams.
   - Review and refine outputs as a solo developer, using checklists and intent docs for validation.
2. **Component Library:**
   - Scaffold new components with AI, ensuring FSD/FCA compliance.
   - Use AI to generate Storybook stories and accessibility tests.
3. **Prototyping:**
   - Build interactive prototypes for key flows.
   - Use AI to simulate user interactions and edge cases.
4. **Testing and Feedback:**
   - Integrate AI-driven usability and accessibility testing.
   - Use AI to summarize user feedback and update intents/designs.
5. **Documentation and Traceability:**
   - Maintain an AI-updated mapping between intents, UI components, and tests.

## 4a. Principle: Visualizing Workflows with Diagrams

To enhance clarity and maintainability, use diagrams (such as Mermaid flowcharts) to visualize UI/UX workflows, user journeys, and process logic. Diagrams help solo developers and collaborators quickly understand the flow of actions, decision points, and iterative loops in AI-assisted design processes. Embedding these diagrams in documentation ensures that complex processes are easy to follow, review, and improve over time. Choose diagram types that best fit the scenario (e.g., flowcharts for processes, sequence diagrams for interactions) and update them as workflows evolve.

## 4b. Enterprise-Ready UI/UX Intent Example Template & Conventions

To ensure consistency, scalability, and AI-assistant readiness, all UI/UX intent examples should:
- Use a standard template with YAML frontmatter (see `ui-ux-intent-example-template.md` in the UI/UX intent flows folder)
- Follow the naming convention: `<feature-or-epic>-ui-ux-intent.md`
- Be stored in `03-development/04-ui-ux-intent-flows/` (or a dedicated UI/UX intents folder)
- Reference the source intent/epic and be cross-linked from intent docs
- Include metadata for easy parsing and indexing
- Be listed in an index file for discoverability and traceability

This approach supports both human and AI collaboration, rapid onboarding, and continuous improvement at scale.

## 5. Example: Traceability Table for Notification Preferences

| Intent/Deliverable                | UI/UX Flow/Screen                | AI Role                | Solo-Dev Role                |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Notification Preferences          | Preferences Modal/Page           | Generate wireframe, suggest flows | Review, iterate, validate        |
| Daily Digest Opt-In               | Digest Settings Section          | Generate copy, simulate edge cases | Review, finalize copy            |
| Notification Channels             | Channel Selection UI             | Generate component code, test cases | Review, test                     |
| Edge Case Handling                | Error/Empty States               | Suggest edge cases, generate tests | Review, approve                  |

## 6. Reflection & Next Steps

**Reflection:**
AI-assisted UI/UX design enables rapid iteration, better traceability to user needs, and more robust coverage of edge cases and accessibility. However, it requires a disciplined process to ensure human oversight, intent alignment, and design system consistency. The biggest risk is over-reliance on AI-generated assets without sufficient review, or losing sight of the user's real needs in favor of what's easy to generate.

**Next Steps:**
1. Select a key intent and run through the full AI-assisted design process as a pilot.
2. Set up tooling for AI-assisted wireframing and component generation.
3. Define a traceability matrix template for mapping intents to UI/UX deliverables.
4. Integrate automated accessibility and intent-coverage checks into CI/CD.
5. Review and iterate on the process, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with user needs.
