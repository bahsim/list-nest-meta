## The Honest Role of AI in Your Workflow

- **AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement for your judgment or expertise.**
- **AI is fast, but not always "wholesome intelligent"**—it can miss context, make mistakes, or hallucinate details if not given enough structure.
- **The more detail and structure you provide, the more reliable and consistent the AI's output will be.**
- **AI is best at:**
  - Expanding, refactoring, and templating detailed checklists
  - Filling in boilerplate, generating code/tests/docs from explicit requirements
  - Spotting gaps or inconsistencies when the requirements are clear and granular
- **AI is NOT a substitute for:**
  - Deep domain knowledge
  - Human judgment about what matters, what's "done," or what's good enough
  - The need for explicit, detailed requirements in production-grade work

## Why More Detail = More Consistency (with AI or Without)

- **Detailed, enriched intent files reduce ambiguity.**
- **They force you (and your AI) to think through edge cases, validations, and integration points up front.**
- **They make it much less likely that you'll forget a step, miss a requirement, or have to rework something later.**
- **They make AI's output more predictable, testable, and reusable.**

## The Relationship Between Enriched Intents and Reliable AI Output

- **If you want quality, reliability, and consistency—especially when using AI—the enriched, detailed format is the best choice.**
- **AI is a tool to help you move faster and automate the boring parts, but it's only as good as the clarity and completeness of what you give it.**
- **You are the architect. AI is your assistant. The more you specify, the more you can trust the results.**

## Principle for Solo AI-Assisted Development

- **Always favor enriched, detailed intent files for any feature or epic that matters.**
- **Use AI to expand, refactor, and automate—but never rely on it to "fill in the blanks" for critical requirements.**
- **Let the file be your external brain: capture every step, edge case, and validation you want to see in the final product.**

**Summary:**
- AI is a force multiplier, not a replacement for clarity or expertise.
- The more detail you provide, the more you can trust your process and your AI.
- Enriched intent files are the foundation for quality, consistency, and reliable automation in modern solo development.
