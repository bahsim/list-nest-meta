# User Profile Management Intent (Universal Example)

**Purpose:**
Enable users to create, update, and manage their profile information in a secure, user-friendly, and extensible way. This intent is foundational for personalization, account management, and user empowerment in any digital product.

## Universal Flows
- User registration and initial profile creation
- Profile editing (name, contact info, avatar, etc.)
- Privacy settings and consent management
- Password and credential updates
- Account deactivation or deletion
- Viewing and exporting profile data

## Key Considerations
- **Security:** Protect sensitive data, enforce authentication and authorization.
- **Privacy:** Allow users to control visibility and sharing of their information.
- **Extensibility:** Support custom fields or integrations (e.g., social profiles).
- **Compliance:** GDPR/CCPA support for data export and deletion.
- **User Experience:** Clear feedback, error handling, and accessibility.

- **For Regulated Industries:** Add audit logging and stricter consent flows.
- **For AI-Driven Products:** Integrate with personalization and recommendation engines.
