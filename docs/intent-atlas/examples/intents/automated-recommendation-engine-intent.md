# Automated Recommendation Engine Intent (Universal Example)

**Purpose:**
Deliver personalized suggestions or content to users based on their behavior, preferences, or context. This intent increases engagement, satisfaction, and business value in any product with a large or dynamic content set.

## Universal Flows
- Collect user activity and preference data
- Process data and generate recommendations (batch or real-time)
- Deliver recommendations via UI, notifications, or API
- Collect feedback (explicit or implicit) to improve future recommendations
- Monitor and audit recommendation quality and fairness

## Key Considerations
- **Privacy:** Respect user consent and data minimization.
- **Transparency:** Explain why recommendations are made (where possible).
- **Bias/Fairness:** Monitor for and mitigate algorithmic bias.
- **Performance:** Ensure recommendations are timely and scalable.
- **Extensibility:** Support multiple algorithms or models.
