# AI Instruction Granularity: Finding the Golden Middle for Backend Generation

---

## Preamble: User Prompt

Let's reflect on one important moment:

> What is better for the AI generation—what level is preferable—what is the golden middle between predictability and quality on one side and performance on the other?
> 
> Purpose: Prepare instructions/prompt for an AI agent to generate backend in an automated way; prepare scripts for that purpose.

## 1. The Tradeoff: Granularity vs. Abstraction

### Highly Granular (Atomic) Patterns
- **Pros:**
  - Maximum control and reusability.
  - Easy to debug and test individual steps.
  - Fine-tuned error handling and recovery.
  - Can be composed in many ways for different architectures.
- **Cons:**
  - Requires many steps to accomplish high-level goals.
  - More complex orchestration logic.
  - Harder to optimize for performance (many small actions = more overhead).
  - May lose sight of higher-level intent/context.

### Highly Abstract (Composite) Patterns
- **Pros:**
  - Fewer, more powerful instructions.
  - Easier to express high-level intent (e.g., "scaffold CRUD module for X").
  - Faster execution (fewer orchestration steps).
  - More predictable, less error-prone for common use cases.
- **Cons:**
  - Less flexible for edge cases or customizations.
  - Harder to debug or recover from partial failures.
  - May hide important details from the AI, leading to lower quality in complex scenarios.

## 2. The Golden Middle: "Composable, Parameterized Primitives"

**Best Practice:**
- Use **mid-level, composable patterns** that are:
  - **Atomic enough** to be reusable and debuggable.
  - **Abstract enough** to capture meaningful intent and context.
  - **Parameterizable** so the AI can adapt to different requirements.
  - **Composable** so higher-level workflows can be built from them.

**Example:**
- Instead of "generate_project_scaffold" (too high-level) or "write_text_file" (too low-level), use:
  - `scaffold_nestjs_module` (with parameters: entity, endpoints, DTOs, RBAC, etc.)
  - `add_crud_endpoints` (with parameters: entity, validation, docs)
  - `add_authentication` (with parameters: strategy, user fields, guards)
  - `add_env_config` (with parameters: variables, validation schema)
- These can be orchestrated by a script or AI agent to build a full backend, but are still granular enough to allow for customization and error handling.

## 3. AI Prompt/Instruction Design for Backend Generation

- **Instructions should be:**
  - **Declarative:** "Generate a NestJS CRUD module for entity X with RBAC and validation."
  - **Parameterizable:** "Add authentication with JWT strategy and password reset."
  - **Composable:** "For each entity, add CRUD endpoints, DTOs, and OpenAPI docs."
  - **Context-aware:** "If the entity is User, also add registration and login endpoints."

- **Script/Orchestration Example:**
  - For each entity in the spec:
    - `scaffold_nestjs_module(entity, options)`
    - `add_crud_endpoints(entity, options)`
    - `add_dto_with_validation(entity, fields)`
    - `add_openapi_decorators(entity)`
    - `add_rbac_guards(entity, roles)`
  - Then:
    - `add_authentication(strategy, user_fields)`
    - `add_env_config(variables, schema)`
    - `setup_ci_cd(pipeline, docker)`

## 4. Performance and Predictability

- **Mid-level patterns** reduce orchestration overhead and make the AI's output more predictable, as each pattern encapsulates a meaningful chunk of logic.
- **Atomic patterns** are best for advanced users or for debugging/fine-tuning, but can be slow and verbose for full-project generation.
- **Composite patterns** are best for rapid prototyping, but may lack flexibility and transparency.

## 5. Recommendation for AI-Driven Backend Generation

- Use **mid-level, parameterized, composable patterns** as your "golden middle."
- Provide the AI with clear, declarative instructions for each pattern.
- Allow the AI to compose these patterns as needed, but retain the ability to drop down to atomic actions for custom or advanced scenarios.

### Summary Table

| Level         | Predictability | Quality | Performance | Flexibility | Debuggability |
|---------------|---------------|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Atomic        | High          | High    | Low         | High        | High         |
| Mid-level ★   | High          | High    | High        | High        | High         |
| Composite     | Medium        | Medium  | Highest     | Low         | Low          |

**★ = Recommended for most AI backend generation workflows**

If you want, a set of mid-level, parameterized patterns and a sample orchestration script/prompt for your AI agent can be drafted as a next step.
