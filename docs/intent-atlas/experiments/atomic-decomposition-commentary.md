# Atomic Intent Decomposition: Output Strategy Commentary

## Context

In the ListNest unified intent system, decomposing high-level intents into atomic, testable requirements is a critical step for ensuring clarity, traceability, and actionable development. The method by which these atomic intents are output—whether as new YAML files, appended to existing files, or simply printed for review—has significant implications for workflow, auditability, and collaboration.

## Option 1: Writing New YAMLs

**Advantages:**
- **Traceability & Auditability:** Each decomposition run produces a discrete artifact, preserving the state of requirements at a specific point in time. This is invaluable for audits, rollbacks, and understanding the evolution of requirements.
- **Parallel Workflow Support:** Multiple team members can review or edit atomic intents independently, reducing the risk of merge conflicts or accidental overwrites.
- **Safety:** The original high-level intent files remain untouched, minimizing the risk of data loss or corruption.
- **Review & Approval:** New files can be easily staged for review, approval, or further enrichment before being merged into the main requirements set.

**Drawbacks:**
- **File Proliferation:** Over time, many files may accumulate, requiring periodic cleanup or archiving.
- **Management Overhead:** Teams must adopt conventions for naming, organizing, and archiving atomic intent files.

## Option 2: Appending to Existing YAMLs

**Advantages:**
- **Centralization:** Related high-level and atomic intents are co-located, simplifying navigation and reporting.
- **Reduced File Sprawl:** Fewer files to manage, which can streamline some workflows.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Risk of Data Corruption:** Appending can lead to accidental duplication, merge conflicts, or overwriting of existing data, especially in collaborative environments.
- **Blurring of History:** It becomes harder to track when and how atomic intents were generated or modified, complicating audits and post-mortems.
- **Limited Parallelism:** Simultaneous edits by multiple team members increase the risk of conflicts.

## Option 3: Printing Suggestions Only

**Advantages:**
- **Non-Destructive:** No files are changed, allowing for safe experimentation and review.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Teams can quickly iterate on decomposition logic or LLM prompts.

**Drawbacks:**
- **Manual Overhead:** Requires manual copying and pasting, increasing the risk of errors and slowing down the workflow.
- **No Traceability:** Lacks a persistent record of decompositions, making it unsuitable for audit or large-scale collaboration.

## Recommendation

**Writing new YAMLs is the preferred approach** for atomic intent decomposition in the ListNest unified intent system. This method maximizes traceability, supports robust review and rollback processes, and aligns with requirements engineering best practices for complex, evolving systems. While it introduces some file management overhead, the benefits in terms of auditability, safety, and parallel workflow support far outweigh the drawbacks. Teams should adopt clear naming conventions and periodic archiving to manage file proliferation.

## Practical Guidance for Teams

- **Adopt Naming Conventions:** Name atomic intent files after their parent intent ID or slug (e.g., `user-auth-atomic.yaml`) and include traceability fields (`parent_intent_id`, `source_high_level_file`).
- **Review & Approval:** Treat each new YAML as a discrete artifact for review and approval before merging.
- **Periodic Cleanup:** Regularly archive or clean up superseded atomic intent files to manage file sprawl.
- **Automate Where Possible:** Use scripts to generate, validate, and aggregate atomic intents, reducing manual overhead and error risk.

By following these practices, teams can ensure that atomic intent decomposition remains a scalable, auditable, and collaborative process, fully aligned with the goals of the unified intent system.
