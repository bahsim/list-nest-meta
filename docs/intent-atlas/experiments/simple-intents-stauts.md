**Short answer:**  
Your current intents in `/05-intents` are a strong foundation, but they are **not yet fully ready to be directly converted into a unified-intent artifact** without some transformation and enrichment.

---

## **Why?**

### 1. **Structure & Detail**
- The current intents are organized by epic (feature/initiative), not by major system domain (as recommended for unified intent).
- Many intents are detailed and actionable, but their structure varies (some are YAML, some Markdown, some mix both).
- Not all intents are vertically sliced—some focus on backend, others on frontend, some are process-only.

### 2. **Missing or Inconsistent Fields**
- Most intents do not explicitly use the `vertical_slice` structure (user, UI/UX, process, backend, data, integration, analytics, test, docs).
- Action types are not tagged or standardized.
- Cross-domain dependencies and traceability fields are not always present.

### 3. **Modularization**
- The current organization is by epic, not by domain (e.g., User Management, Notifications, etc.), and there is no root index file for aggregation and cross-domain links.

## **What Needs to Happen?**

1. **Restructure:**  
   - Reorganize intents by major system domain, not by epic.
   - Create one file per domain, plus a root index file.

2. **Enrich:**  
   - Ensure every intent is vertically sliced (all relevant layers).
   - Add `action_types` tags to each intent.
   - Add or standardize fields for dependencies, status, and traceability.

3. **Normalize Format:**  
   - Convert all intents to a consistent YAML (or YAML/Markdown hybrid) format.
   - Use the canonical structure from your `unified-intent-structure-guide.md`.

4. **Aggregate & Link:**  
   - Build a root index file referencing all domain files and mapping cross-domain dependencies.

## **Summary Table**

| Aspect                | Current Epics/Intents | Unified Intent Ready? |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Organized by Domain   | ❌                   | ✅                   |
| Vertically Sliced     | ⚠️ (partial)         | ✅                   |
| Action Types Tagged   | ❌                   | ✅                   |
| Consistent Format     | ⚠️ (mixed)           | ✅                   |
| Cross-Domain Index    | ❌                   | ✅                   |

## **Conclusion**

- **Your current intents are a solid, detailed base.**
- **They require restructuring, enrichment, and normalization** to become a true unified-intent artifact as defined in your new standards.
- **Automated or semi-automated transformation is possible**—and recommended for consistency and traceability.
