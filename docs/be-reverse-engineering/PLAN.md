# Reverse Engineering Plan (Full Project)

## Phase 1: Preparation
- [x] Inventory all modules, features, and components in the backend codebase.
- [x] Catalog all entities, controllers, services, DTOs, guards, interceptors, and cross-cutting concerns.
- [x] Gather or define the mid-level pattern library to be used for mapping.

## Phase 2: Automated Extraction
- [x] Parse the codebase to extract:
   - Entities/models
   - Controllers and endpoints
   - Services and business logic
   - DTOs and validation
   - Guards, interceptors, middleware
   - RBAC/permissions
   - Notifications, events, schedulers
- [x] Aggregate extracted data into a structured inventory for review.

## Phase 3: Manual Review and Semantic Mapping
- [x] Review the extracted inventory for completeness and business meaning.
- [x] For each feature/module:
   - Attempt to map to mid-level instructions using the pattern library.
   - If not feasible, break down into atomic intents.
   - If atomic intents are not feasible, summarize as high-level intents.
- [x] Document all mappings, noting which features are covered by mid-level, atomic, or high-level instructions.

## Phase 4: Documentation and Output
- [x] Save all extracted instructions and intents in this folder, organized by module/feature.
- [x] Create summary tables or reports showing coverage and any gaps.

## Phase 5: Regeneration and Validation
- [x] Attempt to regenerate the backend from the extracted instructions.
- [ ] Compare the regenerated backend with the original codebase for:
    - Feature completeness
    - Structure
    - Behavior
    - Consistency
- [ ] Document findings, discrepancies, and recommendations for improving the pattern library or extraction process.

## Phase 6: Iteration and Refinement
- [ ] Refine patterns, extraction logic, or instructions as needed based on validation results.
- [ ] Repeat regeneration and validation until acceptable consistency is achieved.
