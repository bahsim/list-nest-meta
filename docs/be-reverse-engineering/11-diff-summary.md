# Summary of Actionable Recommendations: Original vs Regenerated Backend

## Critical, Recurring Themes
- **Pattern Library Gaps:**
  - Lacks support for advanced entity/DTO fields, validation decorators, repository/validation logic, authentication, configuration, and test file generation.
- **Missing Business Logic:**
  - Regenerated code often lacks business logic, error handling, custom endpoints, and guard/strategy logic present in the original.
- **Configuration and Environment:**
  - No support for configuration modules or environment setup in regeneration.
- **Documentation and Comments:**
  - Regenerated files lack comments, JSDoc, and inline documentation.

## Module-by-Module Summary

### Wishlists, Wishes, Users, Offers
- Extend pattern library for advanced entity/DTO fields, validation decorators, and (where relevant) guard/repository/validation logic.
- Manually port business logic, error handling, and custom endpoints from original to regen.
- Enhance extraction/mapping logic to capture all fields, decorators, business logic, and custom logic in entities, DTOs, services, controllers, and guards.

### Auth
- Extend pattern library for authentication logic, error handling, and custom guard/strategy logic.
- Manually port authentication logic, error handling, and custom guard/strategy logic from original to regen.
- Enhance extraction/mapping logic to capture all authentication, error handling, and custom logic in services, controllers, guards, and strategies.

### Config
- Extend pattern library to support configuration modules and environment setup.
- Manually port configuration logic and shared settings from original to regen.
- Enhance extraction/mapping logic to detect and generate configuration files and modules.

## Next Steps
- Prioritize pattern library extension and extraction/mapping improvements.
- Plan for manual porting of business logic and configuration as an interim solution.
- Add support for documentation and test file generation in future iterations.
