# Onboarding Wizard Intent (Universal Example)

**Purpose:**
Guide new users through a multi-step setup or configuration process, ensuring they are activated, informed, and ready to use the product. This intent is key for reducing churn and increasing user engagement in any digital experience.

## Universal Flows
- Welcome and introduction
- Step-by-step data collection (profile, preferences, etc.)
- Progress tracking and navigation (next, back, skip)
- Save/resume onboarding state
- Final confirmation and transition to main experience

## Key Considerations
- **User Experience:** Clear progress indicators, ability to skip or return to steps.
- **Data Validation:** Validate input at each step, provide helpful feedback.
- **Persistence:** Save progress for interrupted sessions.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader support.
- **Personalization:** Adapt steps based on user type or previous answers.

## How to Adapt

- **For Regulated Domains:** Add consent and compliance steps.
- **For AI-Driven Products:** Use adaptive flows based on user data or behavior.
