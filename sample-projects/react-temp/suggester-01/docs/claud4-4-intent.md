# Code Reuse Suggestion Tool - Intent Document

## Primary Mission
Eliminate code duplication across a fragmented ecosystem of interconnected React repositories by proactively identifying and suggesting opportunities to reuse existing code patterns instead of creating new duplicates.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Duplication Prevention
- Detect when developers are creating code that duplicates existing functionality
- Intervene before duplicate code is committed to prevent technical debt accumulation
- Reduce maintenance overhead by consolidating similar implementations

### 2. Knowledge Discovery
- Surface existing reusable components, hooks, utilities, and patterns that developers may not be aware of
- Bridge knowledge gaps between teams working in different repositories
- Promote consistency across the codebase ecosystem

### 3. Developer Assistance
- Provide contextual suggestions during the development process
- Offer clear guidance on how to reuse existing code
- Minimize disruption to existing developer workflows

### 4. Ecosystem Intelligence
- Maintain comprehensive awareness of all reusable code patterns across repositories
- Track evolution and usage of code patterns over time
- Identify opportunities for creating new shared abstractions

## Success Criteria

### Effectiveness Metrics
- Reduction in code duplication across repositories
- Increased reuse of existing components and utilities
- Improved consistency in code patterns and implementations
- Faster development velocity through code reuse

### Developer Experience
- Suggestions should feel helpful, not intrusive
- False positive rate should remain minimal to maintain developer trust
- Integration should require minimal setup and configuration
- Feedback should be actionable and easy to understand

### System Reliability
- Metadata should remain accurate and up-to-date
- Performance should not hinder developer productivity
- System should handle large-scale codebases efficiently

## Functional Requirements

### Code Analysis Capabilities
- Analyze components for structural and functional similarity
- Examine custom hooks for equivalent logic patterns
- Identify utility functions with overlapping purposes
- Recognize type definitions and interfaces that serve similar purposes
- Understand semantic relationships between different implementations

### Suggestion Intelligence
- Provide confidence levels for reuse recommendations
- Explain why specific code is considered similar or equivalent
- Offer migration guidance when suggesting existing alternatives
- Prioritize suggestions based on relevance and impact

### Integration Points
- Support real-time feedback during code authoring
- Enable batch analysis of existing code or pending changes
- Integrate with code review processes
- Provide command-line access for scripting and automation

### Metadata Management
- Automatically discover and catalog reusable code patterns
- Update knowledge base as code evolves
- Remove obsolete or deprecated patterns from suggestions
- Track usage patterns and adoption rates

## Operational Requirements

### Multi-Repository Support
- Handle interconnected repositories with shared dependencies
- Support microfrontend architectures with distributed codebases
- Manage git submodules and cross-repository references
- Maintain awareness of package boundaries and access patterns

### Developer Workflow Integration
- Support multiple development environments and tools
- Provide feedback at appropriate moments in the development cycle
- Allow developers to easily accept, reject, or modify suggestions
- Remember developer preferences and feedback for future improvements

### Continuous Operation
- Monitor code changes across all tracked repositories
- Incrementally update knowledge base as changes occur
- Provide near real-time suggestions for active development
- Maintain system health and performance over time

## Scope Boundaries

### Included
- React components, hooks, utilities, and type definitions
- Cross-repository pattern recognition and suggestion
- Integration with common development tools and workflows
- Automated metadata generation and maintenance

### Excluded
- Non-React codebases (unless explicitly expanded)
- Complex business logic refactoring beyond simple reuse
- Automated code modification without developer approval
- Cross-language or cross-framework suggestions

## Privacy and Security Constraints
- All code analysis must occur within secure, controlled environments
- Source code must not be transmitted to unauthorized external services
- Metadata storage must respect organizational data governance policies
- Integration with external AI services requires explicit approval and data protection measures

## Future Vision
Enable a self-improving ecosystem where:
- Code reuse becomes the default approach rather than recreation
- Developers naturally discover and build upon existing patterns
- Technical debt from duplication is continuously reduced
- Teams collaborate more effectively through shared code patterns
- The system learns from developer behavior to improve suggestions over time
