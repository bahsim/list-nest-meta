To implement the "Code Reuse Suggestion Tool" as described, we will follow a structured approach. Below is a high-level plan, broken down into phases, along with key considerations and next steps.

### **Phase 1: Planning & Setup**
1. **Clarifying Questions:**
   - **Scope of Repositories:** Are all repositories in the monorepo using TypeScript, or do we need to support other languages (e.g., JavaScript, Vue, Angular)?
   - **Metadata Store Preference:** Should we start with `metadata.json` (simpler) or `metadata.db` (SQLite for scalability)?
   - **Similarity Engine:** Do we prioritize AST-based matching (faster) or LLM embeddings (more semantic but slower)?
   - **IDE Integration:** Is VS Code the primary IDE, or should we support others (e.g., WebStorm)?
   - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Which CI system is in use (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)?
   - **Testing Strategy:** Should we include unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests for each component?

2. **Architecture Tradeoffs:**
   - **Metadata Store:** JSON is simpler but less scalable; SQLite is more performant for larger datasets.
   - **Similarity Engine:** AST-based matching is deterministic and fast, while LLM embeddings can catch semantic similarities but require more resources.
   - **IDE vs. CLI vs. CI:** IDE integration provides real-time feedback but is more complex; CLI is simpler but less interactive; CI ensures compliance but runs asynchronously.

3. **Approval Request:**
   - Once the above questions are answered, we will draft a detailed system design for approval.

### **Phase 2: Core Implementation**
1. **Metadata Generation:**
   - Implement a TypeScript/Babel parser to extract symbols (components, hooks, functions, types).
   - Store metadata in the chosen format (`metadata.json` or `metadata.db`).
   - Add logic to update metadata on every merge (diff-based updates).

2. **Similarity Engine:**
   - Implement AST-based hashing (e.g., using `jscodeshift` or `ts-morph`).
   - Optionally, integrate LLM embeddings (e.g., using `FAISS` or SQLite vector store).

3. **Suggestion Pipeline:**
   - Normalize and hash candidate code.
   - Query metadata for matches (exact name, signature, or embedding similarity).
   - Generate and surface suggestions (CLI, IDE, or CI).

### **Phase 3: Integration & Testing**
1. **CLI Tool:**
   - Implement `npx reuse-suggest --staged` for pre-commit hooks.
   - Test with staged changes in a sample repo.

2. **CI Bot:**
   - Create a GitHub Action to post PR review comments.
   - Test with dummy PRs to validate suggestions.

3. **IDE Extension (Optional):**
   - Develop a VS Code extension using the Language Server Protocol (LSP).
   - Test real-time suggestions in a development environment.

---

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment**
1. **Documentation:**
   - Write a `README.md` with setup instructions, usage examples, and configuration options.
   - Create an architecture diagram (Mermaid or similar) to visualize the workflow.
   - Draft a contribution guide for future maintainers.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Publish the CLI tool as an npm package (`@org/reuse-suggest`).
   - Share the GitHub Action workflow (`reuse-suggest.yml`).
   - Publish the VS Code extension to the marketplace (if implemented).

### **Next Steps**
1. **Approval:**
   - Await your feedback on the clarifying questions and proposed architecture.
   - Once approved, we will proceed with Phase 2 (Core Implementation).

2. **Initial Deliverables:**
   - Set up the monorepo structure (`tools/reuse-suggest`).
   - Implement the metadata extractor and store.
