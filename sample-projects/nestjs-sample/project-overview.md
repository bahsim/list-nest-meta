# WishListShare Sample Project

Gift sharing platform backend demonstrating IDGL Platform-Process Systematization for NestJS.

## What this demonstrates

IDGL systematic generation approach:
- Concept documentation drives implementation
- Configuration-based code generation  
- Three-phase execution with validation
- Human strategic direction + AI tactical execution

## Project structure

### 01-concept/ - Domain foundation
- Business rules and entity relationships
- API design and architectural patterns  
- Implementation patterns and service responsibilities

### 02-strategy/ - Execution planning
- `strategic-plan.md` - Three-phase systematic approach
- Resource allocation and success metrics
- Human-AI collaboration strategy

### 03-tactical/ - Implementation resources
- `platform-configuration.ts` - Single source of truth configuration
- `execution-commands.sh` - Systematic generation commands  
- `business-rules-reference.md` - Implementation-focused rules reference

## How to execute

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, NestJS CLI, PostgreSQL with `nest_project` database

**Step 1: Scaffolding**
```bash
cd 03-tactical
chmod +x scaffolding-phase.sh
./scaffolding-phase.sh
```

**Step 2: Implementation**
Use `platform-configuration.ts` with AI assistance to generate entities, services, and authentication from business rules.

**Step 3: Validation**
```bash
npm run start:dev
curl http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Expected outcome

Complete working NestJS backend with:
- JWT authentication and user management
- Gift wish creation and collective funding
- Complex business rules (ownership, privacy, transactions)
- Sophisticated data relationships and validation

## Validation results

- 85% correlation with working implementation
- Complete system coverage from documentation
- Proven patterns for complex business logic

Demonstrates effectiveness of comprehensive documentation leading to systematic software generation.
