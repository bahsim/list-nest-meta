# Recommendations, Best Practices, and Onboarding

This document provides expert recommendations for extensibility, maintainability, and onboarding for the WishListShare backend.

---

## Best Practices
- **Modular Design:** Keep each domain in its own module for clarity and extensibility.
- **Service Layer:** Encapsulate business logic in services, not controllers.
- **DTOs:** Use DTOs for all input/output, validated with class-validator.
- **Guards/Strategies:** Use NestJS guards and strategies for authentication and authorization.
- **Database Migrations:** Use TypeORM migrations for production schema changes.
- **Centralized Error Handling:** Standardize error responses and use global exception filters.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Document the API with NestJS Swagger for live docs.
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for all services and controllers.
- **Logging/Monitoring:** Integrate with a logging/monitoring solution for production.

## Extensibility Recommendations
- **Add Features:** Follow the modular structure for new features.
- **Refactor with Care:** Use the service layer for business logic to ease refactoring.
- **Security:** Use environment variables for secrets, add rate limiting, and sanitize inputs.
- **Documentation:** Keep diagrams and conceptual docs up to date as the system evolves.

## Critical Implementation Considerations
- **Business Rules Compliance:** Always validate against documented business constraints (see [business-rules.md](./business-rules.md))
- **Cultural Localization:** Consider user context and linguistic elements (see [localization-context.md](./localization-context.md))
- **Advanced Patterns:** Implement sophisticated patterns for security and performance (see [implementation-patterns.md](./implementation-patterns.md))
- **Data Transformation:** Use monetary precision patterns for all financial operations
- **Transaction Management:** Implement atomic operations for complex business logic
- **Privacy Controls:** Respect offer visibility and owner-based data filtering

## Security Enhancement Priorities
- **Password Security:** Implement conditional hashing and serialization exclusion patterns
- **Data Privacy:** Enforce owner-based data filtering for sensitive information
- **Input Validation:** Use appropriate localization for user-facing validation messages
- **Authorization:** Implement comprehensive ownership checks before any modification operations

## Onboarding Checklist
- Review this documentation and diagrams.
- Set up the database and environment variables.
- Run the backend and frontend locally.
- Use Swagger or Postman to explore the API.
- Follow the modular structure for any new features.
- Write and run tests before merging changes.
