# Domain Models: Properties and Relationships

This document provides an expert-level summary of the main properties, relationships, and validation rules for the core domain models in the КупиПодариДай backend. It integrates detailed field definitions, relationship types, validation decorators, and advanced notes. An ER diagram is included for visual reference.

## General Patterns
- **Validation:** All fields validated with class-validator decorators (@Length, @IsEmail, @IsUrl, @Min, @Transform, @Exclude)
- **Timestamps:** All entities have `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields managed by TypeORM
- **Relationships:** Associations are explicitly defined using TypeORM decorators (one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)
- **Ownership and business rules:** Enforced in services
