- **Complex Validation Logic:** Multi-field validation rules and constraints
- **Offer Constraints:** Business rules around offer amounts and limits
- **Ownership Rules:** Complex ownership validation and editing constraints
- **Transaction Patterns:** Money handling and precision requirements

**Critical Business Rules Not Documented:**
1. **Offer Amount Validation:** Must be ≤ (wish.price - wish.raised)
2. **Wish Editing Constraints:** Cannot edit wish with existing offers
3. **Owner-Only Operations:** Only wish owners can edit/delete wishes
4. **Money Precision:** Decimal handling for currency calculations
5. **Authentication Requirements:** Specific operations requiring authentication

**Impact:**
- **Development Confusion:** Developers miss critical business constraints
- **Bug Introduction:** Incomplete understanding leads to business logic errors
- **Testing Gaps:** Missing business rules lead to incomplete test coverage
- **Product Requirements:** Business stakeholders lack complete business logic documentation

### **❌ Implementation Patterns (30% Coverage)**
**What's Missing:**
- **Advanced TypeORM Patterns:** Dynamic relation loading, complex queries
- **Error Handling Strategy:** Contextual exception throwing patterns
- **Security Implementation:** Password hashing, serialization exclusion
- **Performance Patterns:** Query optimization and pagination strategies

**Advanced Patterns Not Captured:**
1. **Conditional Relation Loading:** Based on authentication status
2. **Dynamic Query Building:** Multi-field search with LIKE operations
3. **Monetary Precision Handling:** Decimal transformation for currency
4. **Context-Aware Exception Throwing:** Different exceptions for different scenarios
5. **Service Composition:** Complex service interaction patterns

### **❌ Data Visibility Rules (25% Coverage)**
**What's Missing:**
- **Owner-Based Filtering:** Different data visibility based on ownership
- **Authentication-Based Access:** Different data access for authenticated vs anonymous
- **Privacy Controls:** Hidden offers and anonymous contribution patterns
- **Data Security:** Sensitive field exclusion and access control
