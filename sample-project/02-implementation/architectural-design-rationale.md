## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The IDGL framework employs a **dependency-driven, complexity-progressive architecture** that systematically builds NestJS backends through carefully orchestrated phases and steps. This ordering is **not arbitrary** but reflects sophisticated architectural principles that maximize development efficiency, minimize risk, and ensure maintainable, scalable code generation.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- **Dependency-First Ordering:** Lower-level components generated before higher-level consumers
- **Complexity Progression:** Simple foundational elements before complex business logic
- **Failure Isolation:** Early detection and containment of architectural issues
- **AI-Friendly Decomposition:** Manageable cognitive load for generative AI systems

## üèóÔ∏è PHASE-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

### **Two-Phase Strategic Design**

#### **Phase 1: Scaffolding - Infrastructure Foundation**
**Strategic Purpose:** Establish structural foundation before functional implementation

**What It Provides:**
- NestJS module scaffolding (users, wishes, wishlists, offers, auth)
- Dependency installation and configuration
- Database connection setup
- Basic application structure with proper imports
- Swagger documentation endpoint configuration

**Why It Must Come First:**
- **Prevents Import Conflicts:** Module structure exists before code generation
- **Dependency Resolution:** All required packages installed before usage
- **Configuration Foundation:** Database and framework setup before domain logic
- **Compilation Safety:** Basic TypeScript project structure established

**Validation Criteria:**
- Application starts without compilation errors
- All modules properly imported and exported
- Database connection successful
- Swagger endpoint accessible

#### **Phase 2: Generation - Functional Implementation**
**Strategic Purpose:** Build functional components into prepared infrastructure

**What It Provides:**
- Domain-specific code generation across 6 systematic steps
- Business rule implementation and enforcement
- Complete API with authentication and authorization
- Integration-ready backend system

**Why It Must Come Second:**
- **Infrastructure Dependency:** Requires Phase 1's structural foundation
- **Systematic Assembly:** Builds components in dependency order
- **Quality Gates:** Each step validates before proceeding
- **Incremental Complexity:** Manages cognitive load through progression

Foundation ‚Üí    Contracts ‚Üí   Business ‚Üí   Security ‚Üí    API ‚Üí         Integration
```

### **Step 1: Entities - Domain Foundation Layer**

**Strategic Role:** Data model foundation that everything else depends on

**Technical Dependencies:** None (pure domain models)

**Generated Artifacts:**
- TypeORM entity classes with decorators
- Database table definitions and constraints
- Entity relationships and foreign keys
