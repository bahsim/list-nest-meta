# WishListShare Strategic Implementation Plan

> **Target Audience:** Technical leads, project managers, stakeholders  
> **Purpose:** Strategic context, architectural decisions, and approval criteria  
> **Framework:** IDGL Platform-Process Systematization

---

## üéØ STRATEGIC INTENT

**Primary Outcome:** Working NestJS backend that enables collective gift-giving through community funding with sophisticated business rules and authentication.

**Success Definition:** Backend supports frontend integration with all business requirements satisfied and proper security implemented.

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH

### **Configuration-Driven Generation Philosophy**
Single source of truth configuration drives entire generation process
- Entity definitions with TypeORM mappings ensure database-code alignment
- Business rules mapped to implementation patterns prevent logic scatter
- Systematic validation reduces manual testing overhead

### **Business-First Implementation Approach**
Domain logic drives technical implementation
- Entity relationships reflect real-world gift-giving workflows
- Permission systems enforce ownership and privacy naturally
- Validation rules prevent invalid business states

## üìä SUCCESS CRITERIA & QUALITY GATES

### **Phase Approval Criteria**

**Phase 1 Approval Requirements:**
- Application starts without compilation errors
- Database connection established and schema generated
- Swagger documentation accessible at `/api` endpoint
- All feature modules properly scaffolded

**Phase 2 Approval Requirements:**
- JWT authentication flow functional (login/signup working)
- All business rules enforced correctly
- CRUD operations respect ownership and permissions
- Input validation prevents invalid data states

**Phase 3 Approval Requirements:**
- Complex operations functional (wish copying with atomic counter updates)
- Cross-entity relationships working (offers updating wish totals correctly)
- Discovery features operational with privacy controls
- System ready for frontend integration

### **Quality Standards**

**Code Quality:**
- TypeScript compilation with zero errors
- All business rules have corresponding error handling
- Consistent naming and organizational patterns

**Architecture Quality:**
- Clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure
- Proper dependency injection and module organization
- Database integrity maintained through constraints
- API follows RESTful conventions with proper status codes

**Security Quality:**
- Password hashing implemented
- JWT tokens configured properly
- Input sanitization and validation on all endpoints
- Business rule enforcement prevents unauthorized operations
