intent_id: third-party-oauth-integration
purpose: Allow users to sign in or link their account using third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub).
flows:
  - Initiate OAuth flow from login or settings
  - Redirect to provider for authentication/consent
  - Handle callback and exchange code for token
  - Link or create local user account
  - Handle errors, cancellations, and edge cases
  - Allow unlinking or managing connected accounts
considerations:
  security: Validate tokens, prevent CSRF, secure redirect URIs
  user_experience: Clear feedback, fallback to password login, error handling
  privacy: Request only necessary scopes, inform users about data usage
  compliance: Store and handle tokens securely, support account deletion
  extensibility: Support multiple providers, easy to add new ones
