# Plan: Converting Epics/User Stories to Intents/Deliverables

## 1. Catalog and Review
- Gather all epics and their associated user stories.
- Ensure each epic and story is up to date and follows your conventions.

## 2. Synthesize Intents
- For each epic, write a **strategic intent**: a concise statement of the desired outcome/value.
- For each user story, write a **tactical intent**: what outcome this story delivers, not just what it does.

## 3. Map to Deliverables
- For each intent, identify concrete **deliverables**â€”the tangible outputs, features, or artifacts needed to fulfill the intent.
- Deliverables should be specific, testable, and actionable (e.g., "Real-time sync API endpoint," "Collaborative list UI," "Unit tests for item addition").

## 4. Document and Link
- Create or update intent files, linking each intent to its source epic/user story.
- List deliverables under each intent, with traceability to requirements and acceptance criteria.

## 5. Review and Refine
- Check that each deliverable is necessary and sufficient to fulfill its intent.
- Refine for clarity, testability, and alignment with the "north star" outcome.

## 6. Estimate and Prioritize
- Estimate effort for each deliverable.
- Prioritize based on value, risk, and dependencies.

## 7. Iterate
- As you implement, update intents and deliverables to reflect learning, changes, or new requirements.
