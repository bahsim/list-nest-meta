# Intent Atlas: Manifesto & Guide

Welcome to the **Intent Atlas**—the living heart of intent-driven documentation. This is not just a folder of files, but a universal, evolving map for how to capture, share, and grow the "why" and "how" behind any system, product, or process. Here, every intent, principle, and template is a seed for future work—a pattern for both humans and AI to follow, adapt, and improve.

## Purpose
- To provide a universal, project-agnostic framework for documenting intents, flows, and design decisions.
- To bridge the gap between high-level vision and actionable implementation, for any domain.
- To serve as a source of truth and inspiration for both human and AI contributors.

## Structure
- **principles/**: Foundational philosophies, conventions, and best practices for intent-driven and AI-native documentation.
- **templates/**: Copy-ready templates for new intents, deliverables, and UI/UX flows.
- **examples/**: Universal, cross-domain examples of intent docs (both markdown and YAML).
- **plans/**: Proposals, improvement plans, and conversion strategies.
- **experiments/**: Experimental or in-progress ideas for future evolution.
- **archive/**: Deprecated or superseded docs for reference.

## How to Use the Atlas
1. **Start with principles** to understand the philosophy and conventions.
2. **Use templates** when creating new intent docs—adapt as needed for your domain.
3. **Review examples** for universal patterns and inspiration.
4. **Contribute improvements** by proposing changes in plans or experiments.
5. **Cross-link** your work: Every new intent should reference relevant principles, templates, and meta-docs.
6. **Keep it living**: Add reflections, lessons learned, and new patterns as you work.

## Connection to Meta/Conventions
- The Intent Atlas is designed to work hand-in-hand with your project's `/00-meta` conventions. For every rule or convention, there is a story, a principle, or a template here that explains the "why" and "how."
- See also: [epic-conventions.md](../epic-conventions.md), [user-story-conventions.md](../user-story-conventions.md), and the [Meta-Atlas Index](./meta-index.md) for a unified view.

## Adaptability & Evolution
- This Atlas is never "done." It grows as you do. Add new principles, templates, and examples as your needs evolve.
- Schedule regular reviews and encourage both human and AI contributors to reflect and improve the system.
