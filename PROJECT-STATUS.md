## **Our Guiding Philosophy: The AI-Native SDLC**

**At the start of every session, we will pick up and read: WE ARE WORKING WITH A NEW MINDSET.** This is our commitment to the AI-Native Software Development Lifecycle, defined by these core principles:

*   **Documentation is the Plan:** We do not work from chat history. Actionable plans are created as persistent, numbered documents in the `/development/00-plans` directory before any work begins.
*   **Chronological Lookahead:** Every plan must be documented as a sequence of discrete, chronological steps. A plan must always look ahead, showing not just the immediate next step, but the steps that follow to provide full context.
*   **Rejection of "Traditional" Development:** We explicitly reject long, "big bang" phases and opaque plans. We do not work based on assumptions.
*   **Just-in-Time Actions:** We follow a "Micro-Slice" approach. Every action must be small, justifiable, and the direct, transparent prerequisite for the very next line of code.
*   **Extreme Transparency:** The "why" behind every step must be clear and documented in the plan.
*   **AI-Human Symbiosis:** Our documentation is written for both the human project owner and the AI agent to drive development.
*   **Living Plan:** All documentation, including plans, is subject to continuous discussion and modification via explicit, documented decisions.

### **Our Rules of Engagement**

1.  **We do not execute *any* step until it has been documented within a formal plan in `/development/00-plans` and that plan has been approved.**
2.  At the start of every new session, we will review this entire `PROJECT-STATUS.md` document to align on our philosophy, rules, and the current action plan.

---

## **Our Roles**

-   **As an Architect:** I will continue to define and enforce a clean, scalable system design, as defined in the technical architecture documents.
-   **As a Lead Developer:** I will guide the implementation process, ensuring we follow our workflow, prioritize the right features, and maintain high code quality through pragmatic refactoring.
-   **As an SME:** I will be the custodian of the product vision, ensuring that every decision is traceable back to our foundational `concept` documents.

## **Current Status**

-   **Current Phase:** Phase 2: Environment Setup
-   **Last Action Completed:** The `docker-compose.yml` file was successfully created to define our database service.
-   **BLOCKER:** The previous plan for environment variables was flawed and violated our process.
-   **Immediate Next Step:** Execute **Step 2.2** of our formal action plan: [Action Plan 001: Environment Setup & Backend Slice](./development/00-plans/001-plan-environment-setup-and-backend-slice.md).

## **Project Roadmap: The "Micro-Slice" Approach**

### **Phase 1: Blueprinting (Completed)**
*   **Goal:** Establish a single, unambiguous source of truth.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Conceptual Vision Confirmed (✓)
    *   Documentation Restructured (✓)
    *   Core Epics & Starter User Stories Defined (✓)

### **Phase 2: Environment Setup (In Progress)**
*   **Goal:** Create a reproducible, self-contained development environment.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Create `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL (✓)
    *   **Manage `DATABASE_URL` configuration (Defined in Action Plan 001)**
    *   Start the database service
    *   Run `prisma migrate` to sync schema

### **Phase 3: Building the First Micro-Slice (Backend)**
*   **Goal:** Make the `POST /items` endpoint functional.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Define the `CreateItemDto` (✓)
    *   Update the `prisma.schema` (✓)
    *   Implement the `ItemsService` & `ItemsController`

### **Phase 4: Building the First Micro-Slice (Frontend)**
*   **Goal:** Make a UI button that successfully calls the `POST /items` endpoint.

### **Phase 5: Iteration & Expansion**
*   **Goal:** Build out further features using the Micro-Slice methodology.

## **Current Focus:** We have successfully defined and documented our core methodology in the **AI-Native SDLC**. Our primary focus is now to rigorously adhere to this process for all future development.

**Next Step:** Re-evaluate and re-author our initial action plan, `001-plan-environment-setup-and-backend-slice.md`, to ensure it fully aligns with the principles and workflow of our new SDLC.

---

## Our Process

All development on this project follows the principles and workflow defined in our official manifesto:

**[The AI-Native Software Development Lifecycle](AI-NATIVE-SDLC.md)**

---

## Project Goal & Vision

-   **Project Goal:** To create a scalable, AI-native application that meets the needs of our users.
-   **Project Vision:** To become the go-to platform for AI-native software development.

**Current Focus:** We are executing **Action Plan 001 (Revision 2)**. The plan has been revised and approved. We are now in the execution phase, starting with Phase 1.

**Next Step:** Execute **Step 1.1** of the action plan: Document the `DATABASE_URL` requirement by creating the `list-nest-docs/development/01-technical-architecture/002-environment-variables.md` file.

**Current Focus:** We are executing **Action Plan 001 (Revision 2)**. Step 1.1 is complete.

**Next Step:** Execute the action from **Step 1.2** of the plan: Install the `@nestjs/config` library by running `npm install @nestjs/config` in the `list-nest-be` directory.

**Current Focus:** The `AI-NATIVE-SDLC.md` manifesto has been rewritten and is now under review. All execution is paused.

**Next Step:** The `AI-NATIVE-SDLC.md` has been rewritten to establish a proactive, Visionary/Implementer workflow. The next action is for the **Human Visionary** to:
1.  Review the new `AI-NATIVE-SDLC.md`.
2.  Approve the new process or request modifications.
3.  Provide the first high-level **Vision** to initiate the workflow.

# Project Status

**Current Status:** `AWAITING INTENT`

**Guiding Document:** `AI-NATIVE-SDLC.md` (Finalized as IDGL)

**Next Step:** Our new **Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle (IDGL)** is formally defined and adopted. The system is ready. The next action is for the **Director** to provide the first high-level **Intent** to begin our first development cycle.
