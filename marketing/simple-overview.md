# IDGL for contributors

Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle - A practical approach to AI-assisted software development.

## What it is

IDGL helps developers generate complete, working software systems using AI assistance. Instead of managing hundreds of micro-tasks, you define systematic processes for each technology platform.

## The problem

Most AI-assisted development creates:
- Disconnected code snippets
- Hours of setup and configuration  
- Task management overhead
- Analysis paralysis

Evidence: The ListNest project had 186 task files but no working code.

## The solution

Define one systematic process per platform that generates complete systems.

Example: One configuration file generates a complete NestJS backend with authentication, validation, and tests.

## Current status

Working now:
- NestJS backend process
- Documentation and evidence
- Case studies

In development:
- React frontend process
- More platform processes
- Tools and integrations

## How to contribute

Platform processes:
- Create systematic approaches for React, Vue, Flutter, etc.
- Document step-by-step generation processes
- Ensure generated systems work immediately

Documentation:
- Write case studies of real usage
- Create tutorials and guides
- Share what works and what doesn't

Tools:
- Build CLI tools for process execution
- Create IDE extensions
- Develop validation tools

Research:
- Study effectiveness vs traditional methods
- Document patterns across platforms
- Analyze human-AI collaboration

## Getting started

1. Read the docs at ../docs/README.md
2. Try the NestJS process
3. Document your experience
4. Share improvements or create new processes

## Community

- Focus on working software over documentation
- Back all claims with evidence
- Share honest assessments including failures
- Help others avoid common pitfalls
