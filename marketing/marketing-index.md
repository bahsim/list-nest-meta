Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle - Documentation and resources for contributors and practitioners

## What is IDGL?

IDGL (Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle) is a systematic approach to AI-assisted software development that generates complete, working software systems through platform-specific processes.

### Key insight

Instead of managing hundreds of micro-tasks (which leads to analysis paralysis), IDGL defines systematic processes for each technology platform that produce working software.

Evidence: A case study showed 186 atomic instruction files produced no working code, while a single platform process generated a complete NestJS backend in hours.

## Core principles

1. Platform-specific processes - Systematic approaches tailored to each technology stack
2. Complete generation - Working software systems, not code fragments  
3. Human-AI partnership - Strategic humans, tactical AI
4. Intent over instructions - Focus on outcomes, not step-by-step tasks
5. Evidence-based - Every principle backed by real case studies

## Current status

Production ready:
- NestJS backend process - Complete TypeScript backend generation
- Core documentation - Philosophy, methodology, and implementation guides
- Evidence base - Case studies proving effectiveness over traditional approaches

In development:
- React frontend process - Component-based UI generation
- Additional platform processes - Python FastAPI, Vue.js, Flutter
- Tool integration - CLI tools and IDE extensions
