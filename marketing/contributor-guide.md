# Contributing to IDGL

How to contribute to Intent-Driven Generative Lifecycle development.

## Quick start

Prerequisites:
- Experience with software development and AI tools
- Interest in systematic approaches to AI-assisted development
- Access to AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

Understanding IDGL:
1. Read the philosophy - `../docs/00-concept/idgl-philosophy.md`
2. Study the evidence - `../docs/04-principles/platform-process-systematization-evidence.md`  
3. Try the NestJS process - `../docs/01-platform-processes/nestjs/nestjs-complete-process.md`

First contribution:
- Document your experience using existing processes
- Create a simple template for intent definition
- Write a case study of your AI-assisted development
- Improve existing documentation with clarifications

## Types of contributions

### Platform process development

What: Create systematic processes for generating complete software systems on specific technology platforms.

Current needs:
- React frontend process - Component library, routing, state management
- Python FastAPI process - Alternative backend framework
- Flutter mobile process - Cross-platform mobile development
- Vue.js frontend process - Alternative frontend approach
- Express.js backend process - Node.js backend alternative

Process creation steps:
1. Analyze platform - Study conventions, tooling, best practices
2. Define input structure - Configuration parameters for customization
3. Map output structure - Complete system architecture and files
4. Document process - Step-by-step systematic generation
5. Validate completeness - Ensure generated system works immediately

### Documentation and education

What: Help others understand and apply IDGL principles effectively.

Current needs:
- Video tutorials - Process execution demonstrations
- Case studies - Real projects using IDGL approaches  
- Migration guides - Moving from traditional to IDGL approaches
- Template library - Reusable patterns for common scenarios
- Troubleshooting guides - Common issues and solutions

Documentation standards:
- Evidence-based - Back claims with real examples
- Practical focus - Emphasize working implementations over theory
- Clear structure - Follow established documentation patterns
- Honest assessment - Include limitations and challenges

### Tool and integration development

What: Build tools that make IDGL processes easier to execute and maintain.

Current opportunities:
- CLI tools - Automate process execution with command-line interfaces
- IDE extensions - Integrate IDGL processes with VS Code, IntelliJ
- Process validators - Tools to check process completeness
- Template generators - Create boilerplate for new processes
- Integration scripts - Connect processes with CI/CD pipelines

Technical requirements:
- Multi-platform support - Works on Windows, Mac, Linux
- Framework agnostic - Don't lock into specific tools
- Process compatibility - Works with existing IDGL processes
- Clear documentation - Installation and usage guides

### Research and analysis

What: Study IDGL effectiveness and improve the methodology.

Research areas:
- Effectiveness studies - Compare IDGL vs traditional development
- Pattern analysis - Common structures across platforms
- Partnership optimization - Improve human-AI collaboration
- Process evolution - Refine approaches based on usage data
- Anti-pattern identification - Document what doesn't work

Research methods:
- Case study analysis - Document real project outcomes
- Comparative studies - Measure time-to-working-software
- Survey research - Gather practitioner experiences
- Pattern mining - Extract common elements from successful processes

## Contribution workflow

### Planning phase

For process development:
- Research existing platform conventions and tools
- Study similar IDGL processes for patterns
- Define scope and success criteria
- Plan validation approach

For documentation:
- Identify knowledge gaps in current docs
- Plan examples and demonstrations
- Choose appropriate format (written, video, interactive)

For tools:
- Survey existing solutions and gaps
- Define technical requirements and constraints
- Plan integration with existing IDGL processes

### Development phase

Quality standards:
- Complete implementations - No partial or theoretical contributions
- Working examples - All code and processes must be functional
- Clear documentation - Others can reproduce your work
- Evidence-based - Back claims with real usage and results

Review process:
- Community feedback - Share drafts for input and suggestions
- Technical validation - Ensure implementations work as documented
- Integration testing - Verify compatibility with existing IDGL materials
- Documentation review - Check clarity and completeness

### Integration phase

Contribution requirements:
- Follow documentation standards - Use established patterns and formats
- Provide examples - Include working demonstrations
- Update indexes - Add your contribution to relevant navigation
- Create tests - Ensure your contribution can be validated

## Getting support

Community resources:
- GitHub discussions - Technical questions and design discussions
- Discord channel - Real-time community support and collaboration
- Weekly office hours - Community meetings for sharing progress
- Mentorship program - Pair with experienced IDGL contributors

Technical support:
- Process templates - Starting points for new platform processes
- Example implementations - Reference existing successful processes
- Tool documentation - Guidelines for tool development and integration
- Quality checklists - Ensure contributions meet community standards

Common questions:

Q: I'm new to AI-assisted development. Can I still contribute?  
A: Yes. Start by documenting your learning experience. Your fresh perspective helps improve documentation for other newcomers.

Q: How do I know if a platform process is complete?  
A: The generated system must run immediately without additional setup. If someone can execute your process and get working software, it's complete.

Q: What if I disagree with IDGL principles?  
A: Great. Document your concerns with evidence. IDGL evolves based on real experience and constructive criticism.

Q: Can I contribute to IDGL while using it for commercial projects?  
A: Absolutely. The MIT license allows commercial use, and real-world case studies strengthen the community.
